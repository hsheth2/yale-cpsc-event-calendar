DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nAvi Goldfarb\n\, Rotman Chair in 
 Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare and Professor of marketing at the R
 otman School of Management\, University of Toronto.\n\nTitle:\nPower and P
 rediction - The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence\n\nHost:\n
 K. Sudhir\n\nAbstract:\nArtificial intelligence presents an extraordinary 
 opportunity and an extraordinary threat. But not in the way that might be 
 expected. Today’s AI is best understood as prediction technology rather 
 than a machine that can do everything humans do. Prediction technology can
  nevertheless transform industries. It does this by decoupling prediction 
 from the other aspects of decision making\, thereby creating new ways of d
 elivering value. Unleashing this potential requires the invention of new w
 ays of operating\, many of which remain undiscovered. Today\, we sit in a 
 striking phase in the development of this technology\, The Between Times a
 fter witnessing AI’s potential\, but before its widespread impact. On th
 e other side of The Between Times\, when this process of invention is comp
 lete\, the changes in decisions will mean changes in power. In industry\, 
 power confers profits\; in society\, power confers control.\n\n\n\nSpeaker
