 Host:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract:  In this crucial moment when AI is tr
 ansforming the fabric of our society — potentially the greatest global p
 aradigm shift yet — it is crystal clear that the design and deployment o
 f Artificial Intelligence must be grounded in human rights. Similarly\, ge
 nder equality — the very heart of human rights — must be included in A
 rtificial Intelligence design and deployment. How can a human rights based
  approach be applied to computer science\, engineering and innovation? It 
 is urgent that computer scientists\, engineers and policy makers understan
 d the nature of bias\, its technical roots\, its social impact\, and have 
 practical frameworks to think about solutions. It is equally important tha
 t scientists as well as policy makers and citizens feel empowered to act u
 pon their desires for a just and inclusive technology. Our three speakers 
 work in multilateral environments: the Office of the High Commissioner for
  Human Rights\, the UN Working Group on the Guiding Principles to Business
  and Human Rights\, and the activist <A+> Alliance for Inclusive Algorithm
 s. They will discuss the growing movement to apply a human-rights based ap
 proach — grounded in human rights concepts and settled international law
  — to AI as opposed to à la carte Tech Ethics\, and discuss an integrat
 ion of a gender perspective into the everyday work of AI design and deploy
 ment. This conversation is particularly urgent given the scale at which Au
 tomated Decision-Making (ADM) systems and machine learning are being deplo
 yed.\n\n\n\nBiographies:\n\nSurya Deva\nis an Associate Professor at the\n
