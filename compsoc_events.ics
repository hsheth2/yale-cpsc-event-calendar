 essor in the School of Computing at University of Utah\n\n\n\nTitle: Criti
 cal Algorithm Studies - A View From Inside Computer Science\n\n\n\nHost:\n
 Elisa Celis\n\nAbstract: The bright spotlight on bias in algorithmic decis
 ion making has surfaced an older and deeper idea - that technology embeds 
 values\, and without understanding what those values are\, we cannot talk 
 about what we want from algorithmic systems. This critical take on algorit
 hmic systems has long been the purview of thinkers in the social sciences.
  But what would such a stance look like from the purview of the computer s
 cientists building systems? And how might we reframe the design of systems
  to be more responsive to the values we want them to have?\n\nIn this talk
  I’ll talk about two examples of attempting to “flip the script” and
  reframe algorithmic design questions from the perspective of subjects of 
 a system rather than the system designers\, with an overriding goal being 
 to design systems that remove barriers to access rather than reinforcing t
 hem. I’ll look at access in (social) networks as well as access to impor
 tant societal resources\, and in both cases show how this reorientation le
 ads to new modes of inquiry and new ways to assess disparities.\n\nSpeaker
  Biography: Suresh Venkatasubramanian is a professor in the School of Comp
 uting at the University of Utah. His background is in algorithms and data 
 science and he is particularly interested in the social ramifications of a
 utomated decision making. He is a co-founder of the FAccT conference\, a m
 ember of the board at the ACLU of Utah\, and a member of the Computing Com
 munity Consortium Council. His work has received press coverage across Nor
 th America and Europe\, including NPR’s Science Friday\, NBC\, and CNN. 
 Suresh received his B.Tech from IIT Kanpur and his PhD from Stanford.\n\nZ

DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nTawanna Dillahunt\n\, Associate P
 rofessor at the University of Michigan\n\n\n\nTitle: Rethinking the Role o
 f Digital Employment Tools - Providing support among Job Seekers Experien
 cing Marginalization\n\n\n\nHost:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract: Today’s 
 Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are designed to address 
 one of society’s most pressing problems — unemployment. These technolo
 gies are increasingly hailed as enablers of entrepreneurship and income ge
 neration\, and they support job seekers’ ability to search for jobs\, cr
 eate resumes\, highlight skills\, train\, and even help transport people t
 o work. However\, the benefits of employment tools are unequally distribut
 ed and such technologies could reinforce social inequalities. Without an u
 nderstanding of how those experiencing marginalization and who are unemplo
 yed use (or don’t use) ICTs for employment\, the same employment inequal
 ities that occur offline will continue in online contexts. In this present
 ation\, I will discuss the results of several efforts to foster innovation
  and rethink the design of technologies in support of employment\, particu
 larly for those who were unemployed before the COVID-19 pandemic. I surfac
 e broader issues that impact the employment process such as the digital di
 vide and reimagine employment through entrepreneurship and efforts to buil
 d community capacity around digital literacy.\n\n\n\nSpeaker Biography: Ta
 wanna is an Associate Professor at the University of Michigan’s School o
 f Information and holds a courtesy appointment with the Electrical Enginee
 ring and Computer Science Department. She leads the Social Innovations Gro
 up (SIG)\, an interdisciplinary group of individuals whose vision is to de
 sign\, build\, and enhance technologies to solve real-world problems affec
 ting marginalized groups and individuals primarily in the U.S. Her current
  projects aim to address unemployment\, environmental sustainability\, and
  technical literacy by fostering social and socio-technical capital within
  these communities.\nTawanna holds an M.S. and Ph.D. in Human-Computer Int
 eraction from Carnegie Mellon University\, an M.S. in Computer Science fro
 m the Oregon Health and Science University\, and a B.S. in Computer Engine
 ering from North Carolina State University. She was also a software engine
 er for several years in Intel Corporation’s Desktop Board and LAN Access
  Divisions.\n\n\n\nhttps://computationsociety.yale.edu/event/colloquium-by
