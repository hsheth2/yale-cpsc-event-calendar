DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nKobbi Nissim\n\, Georgetown Unive
 rsity\n\n\n\nTitle: Legal theorems of privacy\n\n\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishn
 oi\n\n\n\nAbstract: There are significant gaps between legal and technical
  thinking around data privacy. Technical standards of privacy are describe
 d using mathematical language and strive for mathematical rigor whereas le
 gal standards are not rigorous from a mathematical point of view and the c
 oncepts underlying them are only partially defined. As a result\, argument
 s about the adequacy of technical privacy measures for satisfying legal pr
 ivacy often lack rigor\, and their conclusions are uncertain. We ask wheth
 er it is possible to introduce mathematical rigor into such analyses so as
  to “prove” claims that technical privacy measures meet legal expectat
 ions. We explore some of the gaps between legal and technical approaches t
 o privacy and present initial strategies towards bridging these gaps.\n\n\
 n\nAs a particular example\, we focus on the concept of singling out from 
 the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To capture this conc
 ept\, we define a new type of privacy attack\, predicate singling out\, wh
 ere an adversary finds a predicate matching exactly one row in a database 
 with probability significantly better than a statistical baseline. We then
  argue that any data release mechanism that purports to “render anonymou
 s” data under the GDPR should prevent predicate singling out. Hence\, th
 e concept has legal consequences as it can be used as a yardstick for argu
 ing whether data release mechanisms meet the GDPR standard of data anonymi
 zation.\n\n\n\nBased on joint work with Micah Altman\, Aloni Cohen\, and A
 lex Wood.\n\n\n\nSpeaker biography: Prof. Kobbi Nissim is a McDevitt Chair
  at the department of Computer Science\, Georgetown University and affilia
 ted with Georgetown Law. Nissim’s work is focused on the mathematical fo
 rmulation and understanding of privacy. His work from 2003 and 2004 with D
 inur and Dwork initiated rigorous foundational research of privacy and in 
 2006 he introduced differential privacy with Dwork\, McSherry and Smith. N
 issim was awarded the Caspar Bowden Privacy for research in Privacy Enhanc
 ing Technology in 2019\, the Gödel Prize in 2017\, IACR TCC Test of Time 
 Awards in 2016 and in 2018\, and the ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of
 -Time Award in 2013.\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/93537648931\n\n\
