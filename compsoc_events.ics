 nTitle:  AI & Gender: A Human Rights Toolbox Approach\n\n\n\nHost:\nElis
 a Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract:  In this crucial moment when AI is transforming 
 the fabric of our society — potentially the greatest global paradigm shi
 ft yet — it is crystal clear that the design and deployment of Artificia
 l Intelligence must be grounded in human rights. Similarly\, gender equali
 ty — the very heart of human rights — must be included in Artificial I
 ntelligence design and deployment. How can a human rights based approach b
 e applied to computer science\, engineering and innovation? It is urgent t
 hat computer scientists\, engineers and policy makers understand the natur
 e of bias\, its technical roots\, its social impact\, and have practical f
 rameworks to think about solutions. It is equally important that scientist
 s as well as policy makers and citizens feel empowered to act upon their d
 esires for a just and inclusive technology. Our three speakers work in mul
 tilateral environments: the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Righ
 ts\, the UN Working Group on the Guiding Principles to Business and Human 
 Rights\, and the activist <A+> Alliance for Inclusive Algorithms. They wil
 l discuss the growing movement to apply a human-rights based approach — 
 grounded in human rights concepts and settled international law — to AI 
 as opposed to à la carte Tech Ethics\, and discuss an integration of a ge
 nder perspective into the everyday work of AI design and deployment. This 
 conversation is particularly urgent given the scale at which Automated Dec
 ision-Making (ADM) systems and machine learning are being deployed.\n\n\n\
