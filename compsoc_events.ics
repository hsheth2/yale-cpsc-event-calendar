DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nSeny Kamara\n\, Associate Profess
 or of Computer Science at Brown University\n\nTitle: Algorithms for the P
 eople\n\nAbstract:\n\nAlgorithms have transformed every aspect of society\
 , including communication\, transportation\, commerce\, finance\, and heal
 th. The revolution enabled by computing has been extraordinarily valuable.
  The largest tech companies generate a trillion dollars a year and employ 
 1 million people. But technology does not affect everyone in the same way.
  In this talk\, we will examine how new technologies affect marginalized c
 ommunities and think about what technology and academic research would loo
 k like if its goal was to serve the disenfranchised.\n\nSpeaker biography:
  Seny Kamara is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown Univer
 sity and Chief Scientist at Aroki Systems. Before joining Brown\, he was a
  researcher at Microsoft Research (Redmond Lab).\nHis research is in crypt
 ography and is driven by real-world problems from privacy\, security and s
 urveillance. He has worked extensively on the design and cryptanalysis of 
 encrypted search algorithms\, which are efficient algorithms to search on 
 end-to-end encrypted data. He maintains interests in various aspects of th
 eory and systems\, including applied and theoretical cryptography\, data s
 tructures and algorithms\, databases\, networking\, game theory and techno
 logy policy.\nSeny co-directs the Encrypted Systems Lab and is affiliated 
 with the CAPS group\, the Data Science Initiative\, the Center for Human R
 ights and Humanitarian Studies and the Policy Lab.\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.

SUMMARY:Discussion on Ethics and Society Review Board

DESCRIPTION:Event description\nTitle: “Do no harm: ethics across (social
 ) science research”\n\n\n\nAbstract: Research involving human participan
 ts is usually subject to oversight. Since the Nuremberg War Crimes trials\
 , several core principles – do no harm\; obtain informed consent\; colle
 ctive good does not cancel out individual harm\; no retrospective approval
 s – medical research has been highly regulated\, with similar protocols 
 applying to social sciences and some humanities research methods as well. 
 Over the last twenty years\, various social science disciplines have furth
 er explored the implications of ethics review for shaping approaches to co
 llective versus individual risk\, how to protect vulnerable populations\, 
 and what it means to give consent.\nClaire Bowern\n(Professor of Linguisti
 cs) will lead a discussion around these topics in fields across social sci
 ences and computational approaches\, exploring recent work in AI  researc
 h ethics.\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/99009179026\n\n\nhttps://co
