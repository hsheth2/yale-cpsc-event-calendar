DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker: Lily Hu\, PhD candidate in Applied
  Mathematics and Philosophy at Harvard University\n\nTitle: The Constructi
 on of Social Causation\n\nSpeaker biography: Lily Hu is a PhD candidate in
  Applied Mathematics and Philosophy at Harvard University. She works in ph
 ilosophy of (social) science and political and social philosophy. Her curr
 ent project is on causal inference methodology in the social sciences and 
 focuses on how various statistical frameworks treat and measure the “cau
 sal effect” of social categories such as race\, and ultimately\, how suc
 h methods are seen to back normative claims about racial discrimination an
 d inequalities broadly. Previously\, she has worked on topics in machine l
 earning theory and algorithmic fairness.\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/

SUMMARY:Colloquium on Privacy and Law by Kobbi Nissim
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210305T160000

DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nKobbi Nissim\n\,\nMcDevitt Chair 
 at the department of Computer Science\, Georgetown University\n\n\n\nTitle
 : Legal theorems of privacy\n\n\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract
 : There are significant gaps between legal and technical thinking around d
 ata privacy. Technical standards of privacy are described using mathematic
 al language and strive for mathematical rigor whereas legal standards are 
 not rigorous from a mathematical point of view and the concepts underlying
  them are only partially defined. As a result\, arguments about the adequa
 cy of technical privacy measures for satisfying legal privacy often lack r
 igor\, and their conclusions are uncertain. We ask whether it is possible 
 to introduce mathematical rigor into such analyses so as to “prove” cl
 aims that technical privacy measures meet legal expectations. We explore s
 ome of the gaps between legal and technical approaches to privacy and pres
 ent initial strategies towards bridging these gaps.\n\n\n\nAs a particular
  example\, we focus on the concept of singling out from the EU’s General
  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To capture this concept\, we define a 
 new type of privacy attack\, predicate singling out\, where an adversary f
 inds a predicate matching exactly one row in a database with probability s
 ignificantly better than a statistical baseline. We then argue that any da
 ta release mechanism that purports to “render anonymous” data under th
 e GDPR should prevent predicate singling out. Hence\, the concept has lega
 l consequences as it can be used as a yardstick for arguing whether data r
 elease mechanisms meet the GDPR standard of data anonymization.\n\n\n\nBas
 ed on joint work with Micah Altman\, Aloni Cohen\, and Alex Wood.\n\n\n\nS
 peaker biography: Prof. Kobbi Nissim is a McDevitt Chair at the department
  of Computer Science\, Georgetown University and affiliated with Georgetow
 n Law. Nissim’s work is focused on the mathematical formulation and unde
 rstanding of privacy. His work from 2003 and 2004 with Dinur and Dwork ini
 tiated rigorous foundational research of privacy and in 2006 he introduced
  differential privacy with Dwork\, McSherry and Smith. Nissim was awarded 
 the Caspar Bowden Privacy for research in Privacy Enhancing Technology in 
 2019\, the Gödel Prize in 2017\, IACR TCC Test of Time Awards in 2016 and
  in 2018\, and the ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award in 201
