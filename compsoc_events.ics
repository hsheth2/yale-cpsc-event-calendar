 : Legal theorems of privacy\n\n\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract
 : There are significant gaps between legal and technical thinking around d
 ata privacy. Technical standards of privacy are described using mathematic
 al language and strive for mathematical rigor whereas legal standards are 
 not rigorous from a mathematical point of view and the concepts underlying
  them are only partially defined. As a result\, arguments about the adequa
 cy of technical privacy measures for satisfying legal privacy often lack r
 igor\, and their conclusions are uncertain. We ask whether it is possible 
 to introduce mathematical rigor into such analyses so as to “prove” cl
 aims that technical privacy measures meet legal expectations. We explore s
 ome of the gaps between legal and technical approaches to privacy and pres
 ent initial strategies towards bridging these gaps.\n\n\n\nAs a particular
  example\, we focus on the concept of singling out from the EU’s General
  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To capture this concept\, we define a 
 new type of privacy attack\, predicate singling out\, where an adversary f
 inds a predicate matching exactly one row in a database with probability s
 ignificantly better than a statistical baseline. We then argue that any da
 ta release mechanism that purports to “render anonymous” data under th
 e GDPR should prevent predicate singling out. Hence\, the concept has lega
 l consequences as it can be used as a yardstick for arguing whether data r
 elease mechanisms meet the GDPR standard of data anonymization.\n\n\n\nBas

 peaker biography: Prof. Kobbi Nissim is a McDevitt Chair at the department
  of Computer Science\, Georgetown University and affiliated with Georgetow
 n Law. Nissim’s work is focused on the mathematical formulation and unde
 rstanding of privacy. His work from 2003 and 2004 with Dinur and Dwork ini
 tiated rigorous foundational research of privacy and in 2006 he introduced
  differential privacy with Dwork\, McSherry and Smith. Nissim was awarded 
 the Caspar Bowden Privacy for research in Privacy Enhancing Technology in 
 2019\, the Gödel Prize in 2017\, IACR TCC Test of Time Awards in 2016 and
  in 2018\, and the ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award in 201

SUMMARY:Colloquium on Privacy Rights and Data Security by K. Sudhir
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210326T150000

DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nK. Sudhir\n\, James L. Frank Prof
 essor of Marketing\, Private Enterprise and Management at the Yale School 
 of Management\n\n\n\nTitle: Privacy Rights and Data Security - GDPR and Pe
 rsonal Data Driven Markets\n\n\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract:
  The talk investigates how the two key features of GDPR (EU’s data prote
 ction regulation)—privacy rights and data security— impact personal da
 ta driven markets.  First\, GDPR recognizes that individuals own and cont
 rol their data in perpetuity\, leading to three critical privacy rights: (
 i) right to explicit consent (data opt-in)\, (ii) right to be forgotten (d
 ata erasure)\, and (iii) right to portability (switch data to competitor).
   Second\, GDPR  has data security mandates to protect collected data ag
 ainst unauthorized access that breach privacy.  The right to explicit opt
 -in allows goods exchange without data exchange. Erasure and portability r
 ights discipline firms to provide ongoing value and reduces holdup using o
 ne’s own data. Overall\, privacy rights restrict the data that collector
 s can legally collect or use\, while data security protects against illega
 l access and use. We study the effect of GDPR using a two-period model of 
 forward-looking firms and consumers in which consumers exercise data priva
 cy rights balancing the cost (privacy breaches\, risk of price discriminat
 ion) against the benefits (product personalization\, price subsidies) of s
 haring data with firms. By reducing expected privacy breach costs\, data s
 ecurity mandates increase opt-in\, consumer surplus\, and firm profit.  P
 rivacy rights reduce opt-in and mostly increase consumer surplus at the ex
 pense of firm surplus\; interestingly they hurt firms more in competitive 
 than in monopolistic markets. While privacy rights can reduce surplus for 
 both firms and consumers\, these conditions are unlikely to be realized wh
 en privacy breach risk is endogenized. Further\, by unbundling data exchan
 ge from goods exchange\, privacy rights facilitate trade in goods that may
  otherwise fail to occur due to privacy breach risk.\n\n\n\nSpeaker biogra
 phy: K. Sudhir is James L. Frank Professor of Marketing\, Private Enterpri
 se and Management at the Yale School of Management. He is a pioneer in the
  use of structural econometric modeling in marketing. In contrast to predi
 ctive models\, structural estimation focuses on obtaining policy invariant
  estimates that are causally identified and therefore can be useful for ro
 bust “what if” analysis of managerial and regulatory policies. He also
  employs game-theoretic models to theoretically investigate substantive ma
 rketing and management questions. Sudhir’s research covers a range of s
 ubstantive problems in customer and sales/service management. He has worke
 d with a range of Fortune 500 companies and non-profits.  His current r
 esearch agenda expands his econometric modeling work to include issues ari
 sing from big data\, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Sudhir
 ’s research has been honored with multiple best paper awards from all o
 f the leading quantitative marketing journals.\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.
