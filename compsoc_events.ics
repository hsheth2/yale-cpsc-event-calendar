DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nTawanna Dillahunt\n\, Associate P
 rofessor at the University of Michigan\n\n\n\nTitle: Rethinking the Role o
 f Digital Employment Tools - Providing support among Job Seekers Experien
 cing Marginalization\n\n\n\nHost:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract: Today’s 
 Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are designed to address 
 one of society’s most pressing problems — unemployment. These technolo
 gies are increasingly hailed as enablers of entrepreneurship and income ge
 neration\, and they support job seekers’ ability to search for jobs\, cr
 eate resumes\, highlight skills\, train\, and even help transport people t
 o work. However\, the benefits of employment tools are unequally distribut
 ed and such technologies could reinforce social inequalities. Without an u
 nderstanding of how those experiencing marginalization and who are unemplo
 yed use (or don’t use) ICTs for employment\, the same employment inequal
 ities that occur offline will continue in online contexts. In this present
 ation\, I will discuss the results of several efforts to foster innovation
  and rethink the design of technologies in support of employment\, particu
 larly for those who were unemployed before the COVID-19 pandemic. I surfac
 e broader issues that impact the employment process such as the digital di
 vide and reimagine employment through entrepreneurship and efforts to buil
 d community capacity around digital literacy.\n\n\n\nSpeaker Biography: Ta

 sign\, build\, and enhance technologies to solve real-world problems affec
 ting marginalized groups and individuals primarily in the U.S. Her current
  projects aim to address unemployment\, environmental sustainability\, and
  technical literacy by fostering social and socio-technical capital within
  these communities.\nTawanna holds an M.S. and Ph.D. in Human-Computer Int
