DESCRIPTION:Event description\nTitle: “Do no harm: ethics across (social
 ) science research”\n\n\n\nAbstract: Research involving human participan
 ts is usually subject to oversight. Since the Nuremberg War Crimes trials\
 , several core principles – do no harm\; obtain informed consent\; colle
 ctive good does not cancel out individual harm\; no retrospective approval
 s – medical research has been highly regulated\, with similar protocols 
 applying to social sciences and some humanities research methods as well. 
 Over the last twenty years\, various social science disciplines have furth
 er explored the implications of ethics review for shaping approaches to co
 llective versus individual risk\, how to protect vulnerable populations\, 
 and what it means to give consent.\nClaire Bowern\n(Professor of Linguisti
 cs) will lead a discussion around these topics in fields across social sci
 ences and computational approaches\, exploring recent work in AI  researc
 h ethics.\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/99009179026\n\n\nhttps://co
