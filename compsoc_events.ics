DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nJulian Jara-Ettinger\n\, Assistan
 t Professor of Psychology\, Yale University\n\n\n\nTitle: Towards human-li
 ke social intelligence in machines\n\n\n\nAbstract: Virtually all areas of
  uniquely-human intelligence\, from moral reasoning to language understand
 ing\, rely on social cognition. Characterizing its computational structure
  is therefore a central challenge in cognitive science and critical toward
 s engineering human-like AI. In this talk I will present empirical and com
 putational work showing that humans make sense of each otherâ€™s behavior 
 through a form of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). I will show how IR
 L-based inferences guide social reasoning\, even in young children and inf
 ants\, supporting a wide range of human social behavior. Finally\, I will 
 also discuss some ethical questions that arise when considering the role o
 f this technology in potential surveillance applications.\n\n\n\nZoom link
