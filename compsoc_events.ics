 uter Science Distinguished Speaker Series\n\n\n\nSpeaker:\nBernard Chazell
 e\n\, Eugene Higgins Professor of Computer Science\, Princeton\n\n\n\nTit
 le:  Building an Algorithmic Toolkit for Out-of-Equilibrium Systems\n\n\n
 \nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract: Algorithms research has long be
 en preoccupied with systems that reach equilibrium: random processes shoul
 d converge to stationary distributions\; dynamical systems should be attra
 cting or\, at worst\, periodic\; algorithms should terminate and land in a
  “good” place\; etc. Natural algorithms\, those found in nature\, brea
 k all of these rules. What are we to do then? Answer: Build new algorithmi
 c tools. I will sketch some of my efforts in that direction. The talk will
  be aimed at a general scientific audience and will require no background 
 knowledge.\n\n\n\nSpeaker biography:\nBernard Chazelle (graduate of École
  des Mines de Paris\, PhD Yale) has been professor at Princeton University
  since 1986\, where he holds the Eugene Higgins chair in Computer Science.
 \n\nAs Director of the NSF Center for Computational Intractability\, his r
 esearch focuses on algorithms and complexity. He has been a visiting profe
 ssor at École Normale Supérieure (ENS) Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, Univ
 ersity of Paris-Sud\, and INRIA. He spent many years as a consultant for X
 erox PARC\, DEC SRC\, NEC Research\, (where he chaired the Board of Fellow
 s) and Tsinghua University in Beijing. He is\, or was\, member of the Scie
 ntific Committee at ENS Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, and the Institut Henr
 i Poincaré. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Scien
 ces and the European Academy of Sciences\, ACM Fellow\, Guggenheim Fellow\
 , and winner of several awards from the SIAM mathematical society.\n\nA pi
 oneering figure in computational geometry\, Bernard Chazelle is known for 
 his resolution of a number of longstanding open questions in the field. Hi
 s research has also led him to investigate the role of randomness in compu
 ting\, a subject he took up in his book\, The Discrepancy Method: Randomne
 ss and Complexity. In the last few years\, his efforts have focused on “
 natural algorithms\,” with the aim of building a bridge between dynamica
 l systems and algorithms from the living world. Professor Chazelle takes p
 ride in having taught the very first “Integrated Science” program at P
 rinceton University\, together with colleagues from physics and biology.\n
