DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nTristan Botelho\n\, Assistant Pro
 fessor of Organization Behavior\, Yale School of Management\n\nTitle: Eval
 uation and Bias\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\nAbstract: Evaluation Process
 es\, where individuals have the opportunity to assess the quality of candi
 dates (e.g.\, ideas\, products\, exchange partners\, and employees)\, are 
 a mainstay of markets and organizations. Not only are these evaluations in
 creasingly popular due to their use on various digital platforms and organ
 izations\, but these evaluations also have critical consequences for the a
 llocation of resources. Researchers have provided robust evidence that an 
 individual’s ascriptive characteristics\, such as gender and race\, fact
 or into an evaluator’s assessments\, thus biasing observed outcomes. Whi
 le documenting these differences is helpful\, it is essential to understan
 d the conditions under which evaluative biases are attenuated and magnifie
 d to inform policy and possible interventions. In this presentation\, I wi
 ll discuss the results of several projects to understand how the structure
  of evaluation processes affects observed bias. Data for these projects co
 me from a diverse set of digital platforms\, including evaluating entrepre
 neurs\, professionals\, and firms. A focus of the discussion will be on th
 e mechanisms that exacerbate and alleviate observed biases.\n\nSpeaker Bio
