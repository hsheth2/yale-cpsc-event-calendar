 \n\n\nTitle:  AI & Gender: A Human Rights Toolbox Approach\n\n\n\nHost:\
 nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract:  In this crucial moment when AI is transfor
 ming the fabric of our society — potentially the greatest global paradig
 m shift yet — it is crystal clear that the design and deployment of Arti
 ficial Intelligence must be grounded in human rights. Similarly\, gender e
 quality — the very heart of human rights — must be included in Artific
 ial Intelligence design and deployment. How can a human rights based appro
 ach be applied to computer science\, engineering and innovation? It is urg
 ent that computer scientists\, engineers and policy makers understand the 
 nature of bias\, its technical roots\, its social impact\, and have practi
 cal frameworks to think about solutions. It is equally important that scie
 ntists as well as policy makers and citizens feel empowered to act upon th
 eir desires for a just and inclusive technology. Our three speakers work i
 n multilateral environments: the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
  Rights\, the UN Working Group on the Guiding Principles to Business and H
 uman Rights\, and the activist <A+> Alliance for Inclusive Algorithms. The
 y will discuss the growing movement to apply a human-rights based approach
  — grounded in human rights concepts and settled international law — t
 o AI as opposed to à la carte Tech Ethics\, and discuss an integration of
  a gender perspective into the everyday work of AI design and deployment. 
 This conversation is particularly urgent given the scale at which Automate
 d Decision-Making (ADM) systems and machine learning are being deployed.\n
