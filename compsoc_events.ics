DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nSeny Kamara\n\, Associate Profess
 or ofÂ Computer Science at Brown University\n\nTitle: Algorithms for the P
 eople\n\nAbstract:\n\nAlgorithms have transformed every aspect of society\
 , including communication\, transportation\, commerce\, finance\, and heal
 th. The revolution enabled by computing has been extraordinarily valuable.
  The largest tech companies generate a trillion dollars a year and employ 
 1 million people. But technology does not affect everyone in the same way.
  In this talk\, we will examine how new technologies affect marginalized c
 ommunities and think about what technology and academic research would loo
 k like if its goal was to serve the disenfranchised.\n\nSpeaker biography:
  Seny Kamara is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown Univer
 sity and Chief Scientist at Aroki Systems. Before joining Brown\, he was a
  researcher at Microsoft Research (Redmond Lab).\nHis research is in crypt
 ography and is driven by real-world problems from privacy\, security and s
 urveillance. He has worked extensively on the design and cryptanalysis of 
 encrypted search algorithms\, which are efficient algorithms to search on 
 end-to-end encrypted data. He maintains interests in various aspects of th
 eory and systems\, including applied and theoretical cryptography\, data s
 tructures and algorithms\, databases\, networking\, game theory and techno
 logy policy.\nSeny co-directs the Encrypted Systems Lab and is affiliated 
 with the CAPS group\, the Data Science Initiative\, the Center for Human R
 ights and Humanitarian Studies and the Policy Lab.\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.
