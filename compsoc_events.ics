 ost:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract:  In this crucial moment when AI is tra
 nsforming the fabric of our society — potentially the greatest global pa
 radigm shift yet — it is crystal clear that the design and deployment of
  Artificial Intelligence must be grounded in human rights. Similarly\, gen
 der equality — the very heart of human rights — must be included in Ar
 tificial Intelligence design and deployment. How can a human rights based 
 approach be applied to computer science\, engineering and innovation? It i
 s urgent that computer scientists\, engineers and policy makers understand
  the nature of bias\, its technical roots\, its social impact\, and have p
 ractical frameworks to think about solutions. It is equally important that
  scientists as well as policy makers and citizens feel empowered to act up
 on their desires for a just and inclusive technology. Our three speakers w
 ork in multilateral environments: the Office of the High Commissioner for 
 Human Rights\, the UN Working Group on the Guiding Principles to Business 
 and Human Rights\, and the activist <A+> Alliance for Inclusive Algorithms
 . They will discuss the growing movement to apply a human-rights based app
 roach — grounded in human rights concepts and settled international law 
 — to AI as opposed to à la carte Tech Ethics\, and discuss an integrati
 on of a gender perspective into the everyday work of AI design and deploym
 ent. This conversation is particularly urgent given the scale at which Aut
 omated Decision-Making (ADM) systems and machine learning are being deploy
 ed.\n\n\n\nAuthor biographies:\n\nSurya Deva\nis an Associate Professor at
