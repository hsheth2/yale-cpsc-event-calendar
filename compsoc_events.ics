DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nTristan Botelho\n\, Assistant Pro
 fessor of Organizational Behavior\, Yale School of Management\n\nTitle: Ev
 aluation and Bias\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\nAbstract: Evaluation Proce
 sses\, where individuals have the opportunity to assess the quality of can
 didates (e.g.\, ideas\, products\, exchange partners\, and employees)\, ar
 e a mainstay of markets and organizations. Not only are these evaluations 
 increasingly popular due to their use on various digital platforms and org
 anizations\, but these evaluations also have critical consequences for the
  allocation of resources. Researchers have provided robust evidence that a
 n individual’s ascriptive characteristics\, such as gender and race\, fa
 ctor into an evaluator’s assessments\, thus biasing observed outcomes. W
 hile documenting these differences is helpful\, it is essential to underst
 and the conditions under which evaluative biases are attenuated and magnif
 ied to inform policy and possible interventions. In this presentation\, I 
 will discuss the results of several projects to understand how the structu
 re of evaluation processes affects observed bias. Data for these projects 
 come from a diverse set of digital platforms\, including evaluating entrep
 reneurs\, professionals\, and firms. A focus of the discussion will be on 
 the mechanisms that exacerbate and alleviate observed biases.\n\nSpeaker B
