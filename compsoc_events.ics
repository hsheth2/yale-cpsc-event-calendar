DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nAaron Roth\n\, Professor of Comp
 uter and Information Science at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nTit
 le: The Ethical Algorithm\n\n\n\nHost:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract: In re
 cent years\, there has been an explosion of reports of automated systems e
 xhibiting undesirable behavior — often manifesting itself in terms of gr
 oss violations of social norms like privacy and fairness. This poses new c
 hallenges for regulation and governance\, in part because these bad algori
 thmic behaviors are not the result of mal-intent on the part of their desi
 gners\, but are instead the unanticipated side effects of applying the sta
 ndard tools of machine learning. The solution must therefore be in part al
 gorithmic — we need to develop a scientific approach aiming to formalize
  the kinds of behaviors we want to avoid\, and design algorithms that avoi
 d them. We will survey this area\, focusing in both the more mature area o
 f private algorithm design\, as well as the more nascent area of algorithm
 ic fairness. We will touch on other issues\, including how we can think ab
 out the larger societal effects of imposing constraints on specific algori
 thmic parts of larger sociotechnical systems.\n\n\n\nThis talk is based on
  the book\n“The Ethical Algorithm”\n\, which is jointly authored with 
 Michael Kearns\, and is available now\, from Oxford University Press.\n\n\
