 \n\nHost:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract: As algorithms trained via machine 
 learning are increasingly used as a component of screening decisions in ar
 eas such as hiring\, lending\, and education\, discussion in the public sp
 here has turned to the question of what it means for algorithmic classific
 ation to be fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairn
 ess conditions that lie at the heart of these debates\, and discuss recent
  research establishing inherent trade-offs between these conditions. We al
 so explore how the complexity of a classification rule interacts with its 
 fairness properties\, showing how natural ways of approximating a classifi
 er via a simpler rule can act in conflict with fairness goals.\n\n\n\nThe 
 talk will be based on joint work with Jens Ludwig\, Sendhil Mullainathan\,
  Manish Raghavan\, and Cass Sunstein.\n\n\n\nSpeaker biography: Jon Kleinb
 erg is the Tisch University Professor in the Departments of Computer Scien
 ce and Information Science at Cornell University. His research focuses on 
 the interaction of algorithms and networks\, the roles they play in large-
 scale social and information systems\, and their broader societal implicat
 ions. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National 
 Academy of Engineering\, and the recipient of MacArthur\, Packard\, Simons
 \, Sloan\, and Vannevar Bush research fellowships\, as well awards includi
 ng the Harvey Prize\, the Nevanlinna Prize\, and the ACM Prize in Computin

 nTitle:  AI & Gender: A Human Rights Toolbox Approach\n\n\n\nHost:\nElis
 a Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract:  In this crucial moment when AI is transforming 
 the fabric of our society — potentially the greatest global paradigm shi
 ft yet — it is crystal clear that the design and deployment of Artificia
 l Intelligence must be grounded in human rights. Similarly\, gender equali
 ty — the very heart of human rights — must be included in Artificial I
 ntelligence design and deployment. How can a human rights based approach b
 e applied to computer science\, engineering and innovation? It is urgent t
 hat computer scientists\, engineers and policy makers understand the natur
 e of bias\, its technical roots\, its social impact\, and have practical f
 rameworks to think about solutions. It is equally important that scientist
 s as well as policy makers and citizens feel empowered to act upon their d
 esires for a just and inclusive technology. Our three speakers work in mul
 tilateral environments: the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Righ
 ts\, the UN Working Group on the Guiding Principles to Business and Human 
 Rights\, and the activist <A+> Alliance for Inclusive Algorithms. They wil
 l discuss the growing movement to apply a human-rights based approach — 
 grounded in human rights concepts and settled international law — to AI 
 as opposed to à la carte Tech Ethics\, and discuss an integration of a ge
 nder perspective into the everyday work of AI design and deployment. This 
 conversation is particularly urgent given the scale at which Automated Dec
 ision-Making (ADM) systems and machine learning are being deployed.\n\n\n\
 nAuthor biographies:\n\nSurya Deva\nis an Associate Professor at the\nScho
 ol of Law\nof City University of Hong Kong\, and a member of the\nUN Worki
 ng Group on Business and Human Rights\n. Prof Deva’s primary research in
 terests lie in Business and Human Rights\, India-China Constitutional Law\
 , and Sustainable Development. He has published extensively in these areas
 \, and has advised the UN bodies\, governments\, multinational corporation
 s and civil society organisations on matters related to business and human
  rights. He is one of the founding Editors-in-Chief of the\nBusiness and H
 uman Rights Journal\n. Prof Deva drafted the report on\ngender dimensions\
 nof the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n\n\nAsako H
 attori\nis Human Rights Officer at the Women’s Human Rights and Gender S
 ection\, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Righ
 ts (UN Human Rights Office– – OHCHR). At the UN Human Rights Office\, 
 she also works on economic\, social and cultural rights\, land and human r
 ights\, gender stereotyping\, digital technologies and women’s rights.\n
 \n\n\nCaitlin Kraft-Buchman\nis CEO/Founder of Women at the Table\, a grow
 ing global CSO based in Geneva\, Switzerland – and the first organizatio
 n to focus on systems change by helping feminists gain influence in sector
 s that have key structural impact: economy\, sustainability\, democracy an
 d governance\, and technology.\n\n\n\nA serial coalition builder focused o
 n impact\, she is founder of International Gender Champions (IGC) with hub

 n\, 2019).\n\n\n\nCaitlin founded and co-leads the new <A+> Alliance for I
 nclusive Algorithms with Ciudadania Inteligente\, a global coalition focus
 ed on affirmative action for algorithms\, so that machine learning does no
 t embed an already biased system into our future. <A+> is one of the leade
