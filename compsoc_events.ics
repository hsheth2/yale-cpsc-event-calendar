DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nK. Sudhir\n\, James L. Frank Prof
 essor of Marketing\, Private Enterprise and Management at the Yale School 
 of Management\n\n\n\nTitle: Privacy Rights and Data Security - GDPR and Pe
 rsonal Data Driven Markets\n\n\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract:
  The talk investigates how the two key features of GDPR (EU’s data prote
 ction regulation)—privacy rights and data security— impact personal da
 ta driven markets.  First\, GDPR recognizes that individuals own and cont
 rol their data in perpetuity\, leading to three critical privacy rights: (
 i) right to explicit consent (data opt-in)\, (ii) right to be forgotten (d
 ata erasure)\, and (iii) right to portability (switch data to competitor).
   Second\, GDPR  has data security mandates to protect collected data ag
 ainst unauthorized access that breach privacy.  The right to explicit opt
 -in allows goods exchange without data exchange. Erasure and portability r
 ights discipline firms to provide ongoing value and reduces holdup using o
 ne’s own data. Overall\, privacy rights restrict the data that collector
 s can legally collect or use\, while data security protects against illega
 l access and use. We study the effect of GDPR using a two-period model of 
 forward-looking firms and consumers in which consumers exercise data priva
 cy rights balancing the cost (privacy breaches\, risk of price discriminat
 ion) against the benefits (product personalization\, price subsidies) of s
 haring data with firms. By reducing expected privacy breach costs\, data s
 ecurity mandates increase opt-in\, consumer surplus\, and firm profit.  P
 rivacy rights reduce opt-in and mostly increase consumer surplus at the ex
 pense of firm surplus\; interestingly they hurt firms more in competitive 
 than in monopolistic markets. While privacy rights can reduce surplus for 
 both firms and consumers\, these conditions are unlikely to be realized wh
 en privacy breach risk is endogenized. Further\, by unbundling data exchan
 ge from goods exchange\, privacy rights facilitate trade in goods that may
  otherwise fail to occur due to privacy breach risk.\n\n\n\nSpeaker biogra
 phy: K. Sudhir is James L. Frank Professor of Marketing\, Private Enterpri
 se and Management at the Yale School of Management. He is a pioneer in the
  use of structural econometric modeling in marketing. In contrast to predi
 ctive models\, structural estimation focuses on obtaining policy invariant
  estimates that are causally identified and therefore can be useful for ro
 bust “what if” analysis of managerial and regulatory policies. He also
  employs game-theoretic models to theoretically investigate substantive ma
 rketing and management questions. Sudhir’s research covers a range of s
 ubstantive problems in customer and sales/service management. He has worke
 d with a range of Fortune 500 companies and non-profits.  His current r
 esearch agenda expands his econometric modeling work to include issues ari
 sing from big data\, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Sudhir
 ’s research has been honored with multiple best paper awards from all o
 f the leading quantitative marketing journals.\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yale.

 f Digital Employment Tools - Providing support among Job Seekers Experien
 cing Marginalization\n\n\n\nHost:\nElisa Celis\n\n\n\nAbstract: Today’s 
 Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are designed to address 
 one of society’s most pressing problems — unemployment. These technolo
 gies are increasingly hailed as enablers of entrepreneurship and income ge
 neration\, and they support job seekers’ ability to search for jobs\, cr
 eate resumes\, highlight skills\, train\, and even help transport people t
 o work. However\, the benefits of employment tools are unequally distribut
 ed and such technologies could reinforce social inequalities. Without an u
 nderstanding of how those experiencing marginalization and who are unemplo
 yed use (or don’t use) ICTs for employment\, the same employment inequal
 ities that occur offline will continue in online contexts. In this present
 ation\, I will discuss the results of several efforts to foster innovation
  and rethink the design of technologies in support of employment\, particu
 larly for those who were unemployed before the COVID-19 pandemic. I surfac
 e broader issues that impact the employment process such as the digital di
 vide and reimagine employment through entrepreneurship and efforts to buil
 d community capacity around digital literacy.\n\n\n\nSpeaker Biography: Ta
 wanna is an Associate Professor at the University of Michigan’s School o
 f Information and holds a courtesy appointment with the Electrical Enginee
 ring and Computer Science Department. She leads the Social Innovations Gro
 up (SIG)\, an interdisciplinary group of individuals whose vision is to de
 sign\, build\, and enhance technologies to solve real-world problems affec
 ting marginalized groups and individuals primarily in the U.S. Her current
  projects aim to address unemployment\, environmental sustainability\, and
  technical literacy by fostering social and socio-technical capital within
  these communities.\nTawanna holds an M.S. and Ph.D. in Human-Computer Int
