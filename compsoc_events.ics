SUMMARY:Colloquium by Bernard Chazelle
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201009T150000

DESCRIPTION:Event description\nSpeaker:\nBernard Chazelle\n\, Eugene Higgi
 ns Professor of Computer Science\, Princeton\n\n\n\nTitle:  Building an A
 lgorithmic Toolkit for Out-of-Equilibrium Systems\n\n\n\nHost:\nNisheeth V
 ishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract: Algorithms research has long been preoccupied with
  systems that reach equilibrium: random processes should converge to stati
 onary distributions\; dynamical systems should be attracting or\, at worst
 \, periodic\; algorithms should terminate and land in a “good” place\;
  etc. Natural algorithms\, those found in nature\, break all of these rule
 s. What are we to do then? Answer: Build new algorithmic tools. I will ske
 tch some of my efforts in that direction. The talk will be aimed at a gene
 ral scientific audience and will require no background knowledge.\n\n\n\nS
 peaker biography:\nBernard Chazelle (graduate of École des Mines de Paris
 \, PhD Yale) has been professor at Princeton University since 1986\, where
  he holds the Eugene Higgins chair in Computer Science.\n\nAs Director of 
 the NSF Center for Computational Intractability\, his research focuses on 
 algorithms and complexity. He has been a visiting professor at École Norm
 ale Supérieure (ENS) Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, University of Paris-Sud
 \, and INRIA. He spent many years as a consultant for Xerox PARC\, DEC SRC
 \, NEC Research\, (where he chaired the Board of Fellows) and Tsinghua Uni
 versity in Beijing. He is\, or was\, member of the Scientific Committee at
  ENS Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, and the Institut Henri Poincaré. He is 
 also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Europea
 n Academy of Sciences\, ACM Fellow\, Guggenheim Fellow\, and winner of sev
 eral awards from the SIAM mathematical society.\n\nA pioneering figure in 
 computational geometry\, Bernard Chazelle is known for his resolution of a
  number of longstanding open questions in the field. His research has also
  led him to investigate the role of randomness in computing\, a subject he
  took up in his book\, The Discrepancy Method: Randomness and Complexity. 
 In the last few years\, his efforts have focused on “natural algorithms\
 ,” with the aim of building a bridge between dynamical systems and algor
 ithms from the living world. Professor Chazelle takes pride in having taug
 ht the very first “Integrated Science” program at Princeton University
 \, together with colleagues from physics and biology.\n\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttp
