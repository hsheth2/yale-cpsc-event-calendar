# Yale Event Calendars

Problem: wanting Yale events in my Gcal.

Solution: automatically updated calendar feeds.

Add calendars from https://yale-calendars.sheth.io/. The calendars are updated every four hours.

### TODO
- Add SEAS events via https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/events/2019-10?type=All&tid_1=3&keys=
- Add cowles events via https://cowles.yale.edu/events/cowles-sponsored-events
- Add events from https://isps.yale.edu/events
