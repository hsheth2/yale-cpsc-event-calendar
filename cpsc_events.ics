DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\n\nSeny Kamara\n\, Brown Un
 iversity\n\nHost: Anurag Khandelwal\n\nTitle: Algorithms for the People\n\
 nAbstract:\n\nAlgorithms have transformed every aspect of society\, includ
 ing communication\, transportation\, commerce\, finance\, and health. The 
 revolution enabled by computing has been extraordinarily valuable. The lar
 gest tech companies generate a trillion dollars a year and employ 1 millio
 n people. But technology does not affect everyone in the same way. In this
  talk\, we will examine how new technologies affect marginalized communiti
 es and think about what technology and academic research would look like i
 f its goal was to serve the disenfranchised.\n\nBio:\n\nSeny Kamara is an 
 Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown University and Chief 
 Scientist at Aroki Systems. Before joining Brown\, he was a researcher at
  Microsoft Research (Redmond Lab).\n\nHis research is in cryptography an
 d is driven by real-world problems from privacy\, security and surveillanc
 e. He has worked extensively on the design and cryptanalysis of encrypted 
 search algorithms\, which are efficient algorithms to search on end-to-end
  encrypted data. He maintains interests in various aspects of theory and s
 ystems\, including applied and theoretical cryptography\, data structures 
 and algorithms\, databases\, networking\, game theory and technology polic
 y.\n\nSeny co-directs the Encrypted Systems Lab and is affiliated with t
 he CAPS group\, the Data Science Initiative\, the Center for Human Rig
 hts and Humanitarian Studies and the Policy Lab.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Martin Vechev\, ETH Zurich

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nMartin Vechev\, Professor o
 f Computer Science at ETH Zurich\n\nTitle: Beyond Accuracy: Towards Robust
 \, Fair and Certified Deep Learning\n\nHost: Zhong Shao\n\nAbstract:\n\nTh
 e desire to deploy deep learning models in the wild has led to a fundament
 al challenge: the need to train and certify models that not only enjoy hig
 h accuracy on a dataset but also (provably) satisfy critical domain-specif
 ic properties (e.g.\, fairness\, robustness\, safety\, etc.). Perhaps surp
 risingly\, creating such models has turned out to be substantially harder 
 than expected\, pointing to key limitations of existing learning technique
 s and dictating the need for methodological advances beyond more labeled d
 ata or compute power.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss some of the recent pr
 ogress we have made on creating deep learning models which come with prova
 ble mathematical guarantees. This progress is largely based on new methods
  sitting at the intersection of different areas including symbolic reasoni
 ng\, statistics\, machine learning\, probabilistic programming\, and other
 s. In the process I will also elaborate on several open challenges and exc
 iting research opportunities which if solved\, will enable broader and saf
 er use of machine learning.\n\nBio:\n\nMartin Vechev\nis a Professor of Co
 mputer Science at ETH Zurich. Prior to ETH\, he was a Researcher at the IB
 M T.J. Watson Research Center in New York\, USA. He received his PhD from 
 Cambridge University\, UK. His main research interests sit at the intersec
 tion of machine learning\, probabilistic reasoning and programming languag
 es. His work has received various recognitions including the ACM SIGPLAN R
 obin Milner Young Researcher Award\, ERC Starting Grant\, SIGPLAN and CACM
  Research Highlights\, and many others. Beyond academia\, he has co-founde
 d 3 startups: two acquired in 2020\,  with the latest\nLatticeFlow\nfocus
 ing on robust and trustworthy AI. He has also spoken at the European Parli
 ament on topics related to AI and democratizing scientific innovation.\n\n
