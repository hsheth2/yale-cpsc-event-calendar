 r\n\nTitle: Open-World Learning for Biomedicine\n\nAbstract:\n\nBiomedical
  data poses multiple hard challenges that break conventional machine learn
 ing assumptions. In this talk\, I will highlight the need to move beyond o
 ur prevalent machine learning paradigms and methods to enable them to driv
 e novel biomedical discoveries. I will give an overview of my work on deve
 loping open-world deep learning methods that generalize to scenarios never
  seen during training and demonstrate their impact in single-cell genomics
 . I will first present a method that transfers knowledge across a collecti
 on of heterogeneous datasets generated under different distributions\, and
  then describe the paradigm and methods needed to discover novel phenomena
 . I will discuss the biological findings enabled by my methods and the con
 ceptual shift they bring in annotating comprehensive single-cell atlas dat
 asets. Altogether\, my work demonstrates that generalization to never-befo
 re-seen scenarios is not only possible\, but it is a necessary component i
 n developing next-generation machine learning methods that can reveal new 
 scientific insights.\n\nBio:\n\nMaria Brbic\nis a postdoctoral researcher 
 in Computer Science at Stanford University. She develops new machine learn
 ing methods inspired by challenging problems in biomedicine and applies he
 r methods to advance biomedical research. Her methods have been used by gl
 obal cell atlas consortia efforts aiming to create reference maps of all c
 ell types\, including the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) and Fl
 y Cell Atlas consortium. Previously\, she received her PhD degree from Uni
 versity of Zagreb while also researching at Stanford University and Univer
 sity of Tokyo. Her research was awarded with the Fulbright Scholarship\, L
 ’Oreal UNESCO for Women in Science Scholarship\, Branimir Jernej award f
 or outstanding publication in biology and biomedicine\, and Josip Loncar S
 ilver Plaque award for the best doctoral dissertation. She has been named 
 a Rising Star in EECS by MIT. She is a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohu
 b at Stanford.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-maria-brbic

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nIrene Li\n\nTitle: N
 eural Graph Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing Tasks\n\nAdvi
 sor: Dragomir Radev\n\nOther committee members:\nMarynel Vázquez\nYang Ca
 i\nElisa Celis\n\nAbstract:\n\nNatural language is essential in our daily 
 lives as we rely on languages to communicate and exchange information. A f
 undamental goal for natural language processing (NLP) is to let the machin
 e understand natural language to help or replace human experts to mine kno
 wledge and complete tasks.\n\nMany NLP tasks deal with sequential data. Fo
 r example\, a sentence is considered as a sequence of works. However\, not
  all tasks can be formulated using sequence models. Specifically\, graph-s
 tructured data is also fundamental in NLP\, including entity linking\, ent
 ity classification\, relation extraction\, abstractive meaning representat
 ion\, and knowledge graphs. In this scenario\,  BERT-based pretrained mod
 els may not be suitable. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is a dee
 p neural network model designed for graphs. It has shown great potential i
 n text classification\, link prediction\, question answering and so on.\n\
 nThis dissertation presents novel graph models for NLP tasks\, including t
 ext classification\, prerequisite chain learning\, and coreference resolut
 ion. We focus on different perspectives of graph convolutional network mod
 eling: for text classification\, a novel graph construction method is prop
 osed which allows interpretability for the prediction\; for prerequisite c
 hain learning\, we propose multiple aggregation functions that utilize nei
 ghbors for better information exchange\; for coreference resolution\, we s
 tudy how graph pretraining can help when labeled data is limited. Moreover
 \, an important branch is to apply pretrained language models for the ment
 ioned tasks. So\, this dissertation also focuses on the transfer learning 
 method that generalizes pretrained models to other domains\, including med
 ical\, cross-lingual\, and web data. Finally\, we propose a new task calle
 d unsupervised cross-domain prerequisite chain learning\, and study novel 
 graph-based methods to transfer knowledge over graphs.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.y
