 nHost: Dan Spielman\n\nAn Almost-Linear Time Algorithm for Maximum Flow an
 d More\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk\, I will explain a new algorithm for c
 omputing exact maximum and minimum-cost flows in almost-linear time\, sett
 ling the time complexity of these basic graph problems up to subpolynomial
  factors.\n\nOur algorithm uses a novel interior point method that builds 
 the optimal flow as a sequence of approximate minimum-ratio cycles\, each 
 of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynamic da
 ta structure.\n\nBy well-known reductions\, our result implies almost-line
 ar time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching\, opt
 imal transport\, and undirected vertex connectivity. Our framework also ex
 tends to minimizing general edge-separable convex functions to high accura
 cy\, yielding the first almost-linear time algorithms for many other probl
 ems including entropy-regularized optimal transport\, matrix scaling\, p-n
 orm flows\, and isotonic regression.\n\nThis talk is based on joint work w
 ith Li Chen\, Yang P. Liu\, Richard Peng\, Maximilian Probst Gutenberg\, a
 nd Sushant Sachdeva. Our result appeared in FOCS’22 and won the FOCS bes
 t paper award.\n\nBio:\n\nRasmus Kyng is an assistant professor of theoret
 ical computer science at ETH Zurich. Before joining the department in 2019
 \, he was a postdoctoral fellow and Harvard SEAS and the Simons Institute 
 at UC Berkeley. In 2017\, he received a PhD in computer science from Yale 
 University\, where he was advised by Daniel Spielman.\n\nHis work focuses 
 on fast algorithms for solving graph problems\, convex optimization\, and 
 structured linear equations. In addition\, he develops hardness results fo
 r basic algorithmic problems and probability theoretic tools for algorithm
 ic applications. His research has won the FOCS’22 best paper and FOCS’
 17 best student paper awards.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloqui

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSiddharth Srivastava\, Ariz
 ona State University\n\nHost: Tesca Fitzgerald\n\nTitle: From Sample-Effic
 iency to User-Driven AI Assessment:\nLearning Generalizable Knowledge for 
 Reliable Sequential Decision Making\n\nAbstract:\n\nI will present recent 
 advances on learning for a range of sequential decision-making problems\, 
 from generalizable planning and learning for long-horizon tasks in determi
 nistic and stochastic environments to enabling end-users to assess the lim
 its and capabilities of their AI systems\, even as these systems adapt and
  learn. In the first part of the talk I will focus on neuro-symbolic abstr
 actions for robot planning and our recent work on learning such abstracti
 ons from scratch. These methods facilitate generalizable learning that can
  be transferred to much larger problems and they outperform existing appro
 aches on tasks that were not seen during training. In the second part of t
 he talk\, I will discuss research challenges and solution approaches for a
  new\, emerging problem: while we expect AI systems to continually adapt a
 nd learn\, the problem of enabling end-users to safely determine the limit
 s and capabilities of their changing AI systems remains largely unaddresse
 d. I will conclude with some of our recent results on user-driven assessme
 nt of adaptive black-box AI systems.\n\nBio:\n\nSiddharth Srivastava is an
  Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computing and Au
 gmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. Before joining ASU\, Sid
 dharth was a Staff Scientist at the United Technologies Research Center in
  Berkeley. Prior to that\, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the RUGS gr
 oup at the University of California Berkeley. Siddharth received his PhD i
 n Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His resea
 rch interests include robotics and AI\, with a focus on reasoning\, planni
 ng\, and acting under uncertainty. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER awa
 rd\, a Best Paper award at the International Conference on Automated Plann
 ing and Scheduling (ICAPS) and an Outstanding Dissertation award from the 
 Department of Computer Science at UMass Amherst. He served as conference c
 hair for ICAPS 2019 and currently serves as an Associate Editor for the Jo
 urnal of AI Research.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-siddh
