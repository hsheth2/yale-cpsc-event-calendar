 reparation for Arbitrary Rotations\n\nAbstract:\n\nQuantum error correctio
 n is essential for practical quantum computing on noisy quantum hardware.
  However\, logical operations on error-corrected qubits require a signifi
 cant resource overhead\, especially for high-precision and high-fidelity 
 non-Clifford rotation gates. We propose a postselection-based protocol to
  resolve this issue. We efficiently prepare the resource states to be gate
 -teleported for small-angle rotations. The preparation of these non-Cliffo
 rd states achieves fault tolerance\, demonstrating the exponential suppre
 ssion of logical error with code distances. The algorithm applies to any s
 tabilizer codes including the codes with multiple logical qubits. We prov
 ide analytical derivations and numerical simulations of the fidelity and 
 success probability of the state preparation. We benchmark the method on 
 surface code and show a factor of 100 to 10\,000 reduction in space-time o
 verhead compared to existing methods. Our approach presents a promising p
 ath to reducing the resource requirement for quantum algorithms on error-
 corrected and noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.\n\nBio:\n\nHyeon

  Khandelwal\n\nTitle: Data Lakes: Discovery\, Data Debiasing\, and Query A
 nswering\n\nAbstract:\n\nData for AI is increasingly reliant on the integr
 ation of multiple sources – sometimes obtained from open data repositori
 es or data marketplaces. Despite decades of research in data integration a
 nd cleaning\, we are still not sure how to construct AI-ready structured d
 atasets – data with descriptive features and representative distribution
 . In this talk\, first\, I will describe how to discover relevant datasets
 \, based on join and union operations from large-scale data repositories\,
  by designing efficient index structures. Next\, I will show how to tailor
  a dataset with desired distribution requirements from multiple sources\, 
 in order to construct unbiased datasets. We will also see how to obtain an
  IID sample over normalized data\, to improve the efficiency of model trai
 ning and perform approximate query answering. Finally\, I will conclude by
  discussing distribution-aware and human-centric aspects of the management
  of data lakes.\n\nBio:\n\nFatemeh Nargesian is an assistant professor of 
 computer science at the University of Rochester. She obtained her PhD at t
 he University of Toronto. Her research interests are in data management fo
 r AI-based data analytics and scientific time-series management. Her work 
 has appeared at top-tier venues including VLDB\, SIGMOD\, and ICDE\, and h
 as won the best demo award of VLDB 2017.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nDavid Held\n\nHost: Brian Scassel
 lati and Tesca Fitzgerald\n\nTitle: Relational Affordance Learning for R
 obot Manipulation\n\nAbstract:\n\nRobots today are typically confined to i
 nteract with rigid\, opaque objects with known object models. However\, th
 e objects in our daily lives are often non-rigid\, can be transparent or r
 eflective\, and are diverse in shape and appearance. I argue that\, to enh
 ance the capabilities of robots\, we should develop perception methods tha
 t estimate what robots need to know to interact with the world. Specifical
 ly\, I will present novel perception methods that estimate “relational 
 affordances”: task-specific geometric relationships between objects that
  allow a robot to determine what actions it needs to take to complete a ta
 sk. These estimated relational affordances can enable robots to perform
  complex tasks such as manipulating cloth\, articulated objects\, grasping
  transparent and reflective objects\, and other manipulation tasks\, gener
 alizing to unseen objects in a category and unseen object configurations. 
 By reasoning about relational affordances\, we can achieve robust perfor
 mance on difficult robot manipulation tasks.\n\nBio:\n\nDavid Held is an a
 ssistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute
  and is the director of the RPAD lab: Robots Perceiving And Doing. His res
 earch focuses on perceptual robot learning\, i.e. developing new methods a
 t the intersection of robot perception and planning for robots to learn to
  interact with novel\, perceptually challenging\, and deformable objects. 
 Prior to coming to CMU\, David was a post-doctoral researcher at U.C. Berk
 eley\, and he completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stanford Universi
 ty.  David also has a B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at MIT.  D
 avid is a recipient of the Google Faculty Research Award in 2017 and the N
 SF CAREER Award in 2021.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-david-he

 n\nTitle: Towards a Statistical Foundation for Reinforcement Learning\n\n
 Abstract:\n\nIn recent years\, reinforcement learning algorithms have achi
 eved a number of headline-grabbing empirical successes on various complex 
 tasks. However\, applying the reinforcement learning paradigm to new probl
 ems remains highly challenging. In many cases\, the existing algorithms ne
 ed to be modified\, and new ones may have to be developed to solve the pro
 blem at hand. In order to do so effectively\, we must gain some understand
 ing about the foundations of reinforcement learning.\n\nIn this talk I wil
 l present some recent results of my research towards this goal. I will fir
 st present an algorithm that can exploit the domain structure to learn muc
 h faster on easier problems\, while retaining state-of-the art worst-case 
 guarantees on pathologically hard ones.  Then I will discuss a fundamenta
 l information-theoretic lower-bound\, which establishes that reinforcement
  learning can be exponentially harder than supervised learning even when s
 imple linear predictors are implemented. Finally\, I will discuss a stati
 stically optimal algorithm to learn from historical data.\n\nBio:\n\nAndr
 ea Zanette is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Electrical Engin
 eering and Computer Sciences at the University of California\, Berkeley\, 
 supported by a fellowship from the Foundation of Data Science Institute. 
 He completed his PhD (2017-2021) in the Institute for Computational and Ma
 thematical Engineering at Stanford University\, advised by Prof Emma Bruns
 kill and Mykel J. Kochenderfer. His PhD dissertation investigated modern 
 Reinforcement Learning challenges such as exploration\, function approxima
 tion\, adaptivity\, and learning from offline data. His work was supported
  by a Total Innovation Fellowship and his PhD thesis was awarded the Gene
  Golub Outstanding Dissertation Award from his department. Andrea’s back
 ground is in mechanical engineering. Before Stanford\, he worked as a soft
 ware developer in high-performance computing\, as well as at the von Karma
 n Institute for Fluid Dynamics\, a NATO-affiliated international research 
 establishment.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-andrea-zanette

 \n\nTitle: Robust and Equitable Uncertainty Estimation\n\nAbstract:\n\nMac
 hine learning provides us with an amazing set of tools to make predictions
 \, but how much should we trust particular predictions? To answer this\, w
 e need a way of estimating the confidence we should have in particular pre
 dictions of black-box models. Standard tools for doing this give guarantee
 s that are averages over predictions. For instance\, in a medical applicat
 ion\, such tools might paper over poor performance on one medically releva
 nt demographic group if it is made up for by higher performance on another
  group. Standard methods also depend on the data distribution being static
  — in other words\, the future should be like the past.\n\nIn this talk\
 , I will describe new techniques to address both these problems: a way to 
 produce prediction sets for arbitrary black-box prediction methods that ha
 ve correct empirical coverage even when the data distribution might change
  in arbitrary\, unanticipated ways and such that we have correct coverage 
 even when we zoom in to focus on demographic groups that can be arbitrary 
 and intersecting. When we just want correct group-wise coverage and are wi
 lling to assume that the future will look like the past\, our algorithms a
 re especially simple. We draw on ideas and techniques from the economic li
 teratures on calibration\, expert testing\, and property elicitation\, as 
 well as recent work in algorithmic fairness.\n\nThis talk is based on four
  papers that are joint works with Osbert Bastani\, Varun Gupta\, Changhwa 
 Lee\, Chris Jung\, Mallesh Pai\, Georgy Noarov\, Ramya Ramalingam\, and Ra
 kesh Vohra.\n\nBio:\n\nAaron Roth is the Henry Salvatori Professor of Comp
 uter and Cognitive Science\, in the Computer and Information Sciences depa
 rtment at the University of Pennsylvania\, with a secondary appointment in
  the Wharton statistics department. He is affiliated with the Warren Cente

 al Systems Engineering (NETS) program.  He is also an Amazon Scholar at A
 mazon AWS. He is the recipient of a Presidential Early Career Award for Sc
 ientists and Engineers (PECASE) awarded by President Obama in 2016\, an Al
 fred P. Sloan Research Fellowship\, an NSF CAREER award\, and research awa
 rds from Yahoo\, Amazon\, and Google.  His research focuses on the algori
 thmic foundations of data privacy\, algorithmic fairness\, game theory\, l
 earning theory\, and machine learning.  Together with Cynthia Dwork\, he 
 is the author of the book “The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential P
 rivacy.” Together with Michael Kearns\, he is the author of “The Ethic
