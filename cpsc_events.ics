 s crucial moment when AI is transforming the fabric of our society — pot
 entially the greatest global paradigm shift yet — it is crystal clear th
 at the design and deployment of Artificial Intelligence must be grounded i
 n human rights. Similarly\, gender equality — the very heart of human ri
 ghts — must be included in Artificial Intelligence design and deployment
 . How can a human rights based approach be applied to computer science\, e
 ngineering and innovation? It is urgent that computer scientists\, enginee
 rs and policy makers understand the nature of bias\, its technical roots\,
  its social impact\, and have practical frameworks to think about solution
 s. It is equally important that scientists as well as policy makers and ci
 tizens feel empowered to act upon their desires for a just and inclusive t
 echnology. Our three speakers work in multilateral environments: the Offic
 e of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\, the UN Working Group on the 
 Guiding Principles to Business and Human Rights\, and the activist <A+> Al
 liance for Inclusive Algorithms. They will discuss the growing movement to
  apply a human-rights based approach — grounded in human rights concepts
  and settled international law — to AI as opposed to à la carte Tech Et
 hics\, and discuss an integration of a gender perspective into the everyda
 y work of AI design and deployment. This conversation is particularly urge
 nt given the scale at which Automated Decision-Making (ADM) systems and ma
 chine learning are being deployed.\n\n\nSpeaker biographies:\n\n\nSurya De

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Theodore Kim\, Yale University

 he algorithms used for Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) in film today were
  developed over the course of the last 45 years. In the beginning\, they c
 ould only depict a limited set of visual phenomena\, which filmmakers took
  up as a creative challenge. These early efforts resulted in some of the m
 ost memorable images in cinema\, from\nToy Story\nto\nTerminator 2: Judgem
 ent Day\n. However\, as these CGI gained more attention and attracted more
  money\, the insidious effects of systemic racism crept into the design of
  subsequent algorithms. As a result\, the techniques for rendering digital
  “humans” we use today were specifically designed to depict the domina
 nt visual features of young\, white people. In this talk\, I will describe
  how we got here\, what it might mean\, and where we can go next.\n\nBio:\

SUMMARY:CS Talk - Yuanzhi Li\, CMU

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\n\nYuanzhi Li\n\, CMU\n\nTitle: On
  the power of over-parameterization in neural networks – Going beyond N
 TKs\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/97035602733\n\nHost: Nisheeth Vi
 shnoi\n\nAbstract:\n\nOver-parameterization is one of the most widely used
  tools in deep learning: It has been observed that larger neural networks 
 (e.g. networks with much more parameters than the total number of trainin
 g data) are often much easier to train and also generalizes better compar
 ing to smaller ones. Prior works try to explain this phenomenon in the lan
 guage of neural tangent kernels (NTKs)\, which shows the power of the over
 -parameterized neural network to learn functions that are learnable by ker
 nel methods. In this work\, we go beyond the theory of NTKs and consider 
 the power of over-parameterization in ReLU neural networks when the target
  function is (provably) not learnable by kernel methods.\n\nIn this work\,
  we look at the most simple example in this regime\, where the concept cla
 ss consists of (proper-parameterized) two-layer ReLU neural networks and t
 he input follows from standard Gaussian distribution. In this case\, to le
 arn functions from this concept class\, we prove (1). Any kernel methods (
 including those NTKs given by any neural networks of any structure) can n
 ot achieve small generalization error unless super polynomially many trai
 ning examples are used. (2). (Poly-size) Over-parameterized two-layer ReLU
  neural networks can learn the target efficiently (using poly-sample and 
 in poly-time)\, simply using (stochastic) gradient descent starting from
  random initialization.\n\nOur work relies on a brand new framework for an
 alyzing over-parameterization in deep learning: We first show that in the 
 ideal case where there are infinitely many neurons and infinitely many tra
 ining examples\, the training objective reduces to a mixture of PCA + ten
 sor decomposition objectives. Although being highly non-convex\, we show t
 hat starting from random initialization\, gradient descent can still opt
 imize this objective efficiently. We then introduce an efficient coupling 
 between the idealized process and the poly-sample\, poly-neuron case\, sho
 wing the convergence of the latter.\n\nPaper:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2007.

 d Kim\n\nAbstract:\n\nHair simulation in animated feature films presents m
 any challenges\, ranging from incorporating artistic control to dealing wi
 th extreme\, non-physical character motion. In a production environment\, 
 hair simulation needs to be fast\, stable\, and usable without excessive p
 arameter tuning in order to produce content efficiently. These challenges 
 only increase when simulating a variety of hair styles on numerous charact
 ers in the film. In this talk I will present our method for stably simulat
 ing stylized hair that addresses these artistic needs and performance dema
 nds. In addition to the underlying hair model that defines the physical mo
 tion\, I will discuss various artistic controls and approaches used to pro
 duce our final hair simulations in several feature films.\n\nBio:\n\nHayle
 y Iben is the Director of Engineering for Applications in the Software R&D
  department at Pixar Animation Studios. Her teams are responsible for film
  production technologies for sets\, layout\, characters\, shading\, crowds
 \, animation\, simulation\, lighting and rendering. Prior to undertaking t
 his role\, Hayley led the engineering team responsible for character simul
 ation technologies\, including cloth\, hair\, flesh\, and skin\, for seven
  of her fourteen years at the studio. Hayley’s expertise is in hair simu
 lation and she has been developing the studio’s hair technology\, Taz\, 
 that debuted in Disney Pixar’s “Brave”. She has also built tools for
  character articulation and animation\, focusing on inverse kinematics and
  mathematical techniques. Hayley earned a B.S. in computer science from Du
 quesne University and a M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Univer
 sity of California\, Berkeley.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-disting

 y full professors of professional schools with secondary appointments in a
  Faculty of Arts and Sciences department and explicit Corporation approval
  for such voting rights. The only exception to this rule is for faculty in

 eeting of the Joint Boards consists of 37 members eligible to vote. No vot
 e has force if the number of votes\, plus recorded abstentions\, falls sho
