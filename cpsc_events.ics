 jee\n\nAbstract:\n\nStorage technology has undergone rapid change in the p
 ast years. For many decades\, hard disk drives were the dominant medium\; 
 then\, Flash-based systems came into existence and started to dominate in 
 some regimes (e.g.\, where performance was critical). Now\, a proliferatio
 n of new technologies\, often called “persistent memories”\, are threa
 tening to redefine the storage landscape even further. In this talk\, I wi
 ll examine these technology trends\, and discuss how storage systems will 
 change to accommodate them. I will also focus on aspects of storage that w
 ill likely stay the same\, regardless of technology.\n\nBio:\n\nRemzi Arpa
 ci-Dusseau is the Grace Wahba professor and Chair of the Computer Sciences
  Department at UW-Madison. He co-leads a research group with Professor And
 rea Arpaci-Dusseau.  Together\, they have graduated 26 Ph.D. students and
  won numerous best-paper awards\; many of their innovations are used by co
 mmercial systems. For their work\, Andrea and Remzi received the 2018 ACM-
 SIGOPS Weiser award for “outstanding leadership\, innovation\, and impac
 t in storage and computer systems research” and both are Fellows of the 
 ACM for “contributions to storage and computer systems.” Remzi has won
  the SACM Professor-of-the-Year award six times\, the Rosner “Excellent 
 Educator” award\, and the Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching Award. A
 ndrea and Remzi’s operating systems book (\nwww.ostep.org\n) is download
 ed millions of times yearly and used at numerous institutions worldwide. H
 e has also served as a technical advisor or consultant for numerous compan
 ies\, including Google\, Huawei\, Microsoft\, NetApp\, and Samsung.\n\n\n\

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Martin Vechev\, ETH Zurich

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nMartin Vechev\, Professor o
 f Computer Science at ETH Zurich\n\nTitle: Beyond Accuracy: Towards Robust
 \, Fair and Certified Deep Learning\n\nHost: Zhong Shao\n\nAbstract:\n\nTh
 e desire to deploy deep learning models in the wild has led to a fundament
 al challenge: the need to train and certify models that not only enjoy hig
 h accuracy on a dataset but also (provably) satisfy critical domain-specif
 ic properties (e.g.\, fairness\, robustness\, safety\, etc.). Perhaps surp
 risingly\, creating such models has turned out to be substantially harder 
 than expected\, pointing to key limitations of existing learning technique
 s and dictating the need for methodological advances beyond more labeled d
 ata or compute power.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss some of the recent pr
 ogress we have made on creating deep learning models which come with prova
 ble mathematical guarantees. This progress is largely based on new methods
  sitting at the intersection of different areas including symbolic reasoni
 ng\, statistics\, machine learning\, probabilistic programming\, and other
 s. In the process I will also elaborate on several open challenges and exc
 iting research opportunities which if solved\, will enable broader and saf
 er use of machine learning.\n\nBio:\n\nMartin Vechev\nis a Professor of Co
 mputer Science at ETH Zurich. Prior to ETH\, he was a Researcher at the IB
 M T.J. Watson Research Center in New York\, USA. He received his PhD from 
 Cambridge University\, UK. His main research interests sit at the intersec
 tion of machine learning\, probabilistic reasoning and programming languag
 es. His work has received various recognitions including the ACM SIGPLAN R
 obin Milner Young Researcher Award\, ERC Starting Grant\, SIGPLAN and CACM
  Research Highlights\, and many others. Beyond academia\, he has co-founde
 d 3 startups: two acquired in 2020\,  with the latest\nLatticeFlow\nfocus
 ing on robust and trustworthy AI. He has also spoken at the European Parli
 ament on topics related to AI and democratizing scientific innovation.\n\n
