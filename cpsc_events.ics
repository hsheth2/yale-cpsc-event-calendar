 tle: Geometric Priors for Data Driven Discovery in Biomedical Domains\n\nA
 dvisor: Smita Krishnaswamy\n\nOther committee members:\nJames Aspnes\nRon
 ald Coifman\nGuy Wolf (U Montreal / MILA)\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecent advances 
 in biomedical data collection allows the collection of massive datasets me
 asuring thousands of features in thousands to millions of individual cells
 . This data has the potential to advance our understanding of biological m
 echanisms at a previously impossible resolution. However\, there are few m
 ethods to understand data of this scale and type. While neural networks ha
 ve made tremendous progress on supervised learning problems\, there is sti
 ll much work to be done in making them useful for discovery in data with m
 ore difficult to represent supervision. The flexibility and expressiveness
  of neural networks is sometimes a hindrance in these less supervised doma
 ins\, as is the case when extracting knowledge from biomedical data. One t
 ype of prior knowledge that is more common in biological data comes in the
  form of geometric constraints.\n\nIn this thesis\, we aim to leverage thi
 s geometric knowledge to create scalable and interpretable models to under
 stand this data. Encoding geometric priors into neural network and graph m
 odels allows us to characterize the models’ solutions as they relate to 
 the fields of graph signal processing and optimal transport. These links a
 llow us to understand and interpret this datatype. We divide this work int
 o three sections. The first borrows concepts from graph signal processing 
 to construct more interpretable and performant neural networks by constrai
 ning and structuring the architecture. The second borrows from the theory 
 of optimal transport to perform anomaly detection and trajectory inference
  efficiently and with theoretical guarantees. The third examines how to co
 mpare distributions over an underlying manifold\, which can be used to und
 erstand how different perturbations or conditions relate. For this we desi
 gn an efficient approximation of optimal transport based on diffusion over
  a joint cell graph. Together\, these works utilize our prior understandin
 g of the data geometry to create more useful models of the data. We apply 
 these methods to molecular graphs\, images\, single-cell sequencing\, and 
 health record data.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-

  Data exploitation and privacy protection in the era of data sharing.\n\n
 Advisor: Joan Feigenbaum\n\nOther committee members:\nAvi Silberschatz\nB
 ryan Ford (EPFL)\nCharalampos Papamanthou\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs the amount\, 
 complexity\, and value of data available in both private and public sector
 s has risen sharply\, the competing goals of data privacy and data utility
  have challenged both organizations and individuals.  My work addresses b
 oth goals.\n\nFirst\, I will present a novel Bayesian-network (BN) approac
 h to the mining of publicly observable social-network data. The effectiven
 ess of the method is demonstrated using multiple models that aim at infer
 ring the voting behavior of social-network users in the 2016 US presidenti
 al election. When enhanced with dynamic BNs that model decision making as 
 a complex process that both influences and is influenced by static factors
  (such as personality traits and demographic categories) and dynamic facto
 rs (such as triggering events\, interests\, and emotions)\, this method ca
 n be used to infer social-network users’ intentions regarding actions th
 at they have not yet taken in areas such as health and finance.\n\nNext\, 
 I will present\nPRShare\n\, a system that I have designed and implemented 
 and that enables efficient\, privacy-preserving interorganizational data s
 haring. PRShare makes essential use of the novel cryptographic technique o
 f\nattribute-based encryption with oblivious attribute translation\n\, an 
 extension of attribute-based encryption that supports expressive decryptio
 n policies for both data and metadata attributes.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.e

 n\nTitle: Algorithmic Advances for the Design and Analysis of Randomized 
 Experiments\n\nAdvisors: Daniel Spielman and Amin Karbasi\n\nOther commit
 tee members:\nSekhar Tatikonda\nFredrik Sävje\n\nAbstract:\n\nRandomized 
 experiments are the gold standard for establishing the causal effect of a 
 treatment on a population. In this dissertation\, I present algorithmic ad
 vances for three different problems arising in the design and analysis of 
 randomized experiments: covariate balancing\, variance estimation\, and bi
 partite experiments.\n\nIn the first part of the defense\, we describe an 
 inherent trade-off between covariate balancing and robustness\, which is t
 hen formulated as a distributional discrepancy problem. In order to navig
 ate this trade-off\, we present the Gram–Schmidt Walk Design which is ba
 sed on the recent discrepancy algorithm of Bansal\, Dadush\, Garg\, and Lo
 vett (2019). By tightening the algorithmic analysis\, we derive bounds on 
 the mean squared error of the Horvitz–Thompson estimator under this desi
 gn in terms of a ridge regression of the outcomes on the covariates\, whic
 h we interpret as regression by design. We carry out further analysis incl
 uding tail bounds on the effect estimator\, methods for constructing confi
 dence intervals\, and a kernel method extension of the design which accomm
 odates non-linear responses.\n\nIn the second part of the dense\, we study
  the problem of estimating the variance of treatment effect estimators und
 er interference. It is well-known that due to the fundamental problem of c
 ausal inference\, unbiased variance estimation is impossible without stron
 g assumption on the outcomes. Thus\, we study a class of conservative esti
 mators which are based on variance bounds. We identify conditions under wh
 ich the variance bounds themselves are admissible and provide a general al
 gorithmic framework to construct admissible variance bounds\, according to
  the experimenter’s preferences and prior substantive knowledge.\n\nTime
  permitting\, we will present methodology for the newly proposed bipartite
  experimental framework\, where units which receive treatment are distinct
  from units on which outcomes are measured\, and the two are connected via
  a bipartite graph. We propose the Exposure Re-weighted Linear (ERL) estim
 ator which we show is unbiased in finite samples and consistent and asympt
 otically normal in large samples provided the bipartite graph is sufficien
 tly sparse. We provide an variance estimator which facilitates confidence 
 intervals based on the normal approximation. Finally\, we present Exposure
 -Design\, a correlation clustering based design for improving precision of
  the ERL estimator.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-
