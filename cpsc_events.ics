 : CirC: Unifying Compilers for SNARKs\, SMT\, and More [Oakland’22]\nAut
 hors: Alex Ozdemir\, Fraser Brown\, Riad S. Wahby\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe prese
 nt CirC (“SIR-see”): a compiler infrastructure that aims to support ze
 ro-knowledge proof systems\, multi-party computations\, fully homomorphic 
 encryption\, constraint solving\, and optimization. We observe that these 
 seemingly disparate cryptosystems and verification problems share a common
  model of computation. This model is characterized by being state-free\, n
 on-uniform\, and non-deterministic—we call it the *existentially quantif
 ied circuit (EQC)*. The common model admits a shared compiler infrastructu
 re (CirC) for compiling different high-level languages to different circui
 t representations used by these systems.\n\nWe show:\n(1) CirC makes it ea
 sy to build new compilers for these systems * e.g.\, we reproduce and impr
 ove on a 28k LOC compiler in 700 LOC.\n(2) CirC’s compilers perform well
  (by leveraging shared optimizations)\n(3) CirC enables “cross-overs” 
 in which different back-end systems are combined in the service of a share
 d optimization\n* SMT+ZKP = zero-knowledge bug bounties\n* SMT+X = SMT ass
 isted optimization\n* …\n\nPresenter:\n\nAlex Ozdemir is a Phd student a
 t Stanford\, studying cryptography and formal methods. Lately\, he’s bee
 n investigating how cryptographic proof systems can be made more useful\, 
 sometimes by using techniques from formal methods and programming language
