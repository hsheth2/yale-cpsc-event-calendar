 n\nTitle: Towards Efficient and Generalizable Natural Language Processing\
 n\nAbstract:\n\nLarge-scale deep learning models have become the foundatio
 n of today’s natural language processing (NLP). Despite their recent\, t
 remendous success\, they struggle with generalization in real-world settin
 gs\, like their predecessors. Besides\, their sheer scale brings new chall
 enges—the increasing computational cost heightens the barriers to entry 
 to NLP research.\n\nThe first part of the talk will discuss innovations in
  neural architectures that can help address the efficiency concerns of tod
 ay’s NLP. I will present algorithms that reduce state-of-the-art NLP mod
 els’ overhead from quadratic to linear in input lengths without hurting 
 accuracy. Second\, I will turn to inductive biases grounded in the inheren
 t structure of natural language sentences\, which can help machine learnin
 g models generalize. I will discuss the integration of discrete\, symbolic
  structure prediction into modern deep learning.\n\nI will conclude with f
 uture directions towards making cutting-edge NLP more efficient\, and impr
 oving NLP’s generalization to serve today’s language technology applic
 ations and those to come in the future.\n\nBio:\n\nHao Peng is a final yea
 r PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washi
 ngton\, advised by Noah A. Smith. His research focuses on building efficie
 nt\, generalizable\, and interpretable machine learning models for natural
  language processing. His research has been presented at top-tier natural 
 language processing and machine learning venues\, and recognized with a Go
 ogle PhD fellowship and an honorable mention for the best paper at ACL 201

 oftware Dynamics\n\nAbstract\n\nFrom mobile and cloud apps to video games 
 to driverless vehicle control\, more and more software is time-constrained
 : it must deliver reliable results seamlessly\, consistently\, and virtual
 ly instantaneously. If it doesn’t\, customers are unhappy–and sometime
 s lives are put at risk. When complex software underperforms or fails\, id
 entifying the root causes is difficult and\, historically\, few tools have
  been available to help\, leaving application developers to guess what mig
 ht be happening. How can we do better?\n\nThe key is to have low-overhead 
 observation tools that can show exactly where all the  elapsed time goes 
 in both normal responses and in delayed responses. Doing so makes visible 
 each of the seven possible reasons for such delays\, as we show.\n\nBio\n\
 nRichard L. Sites wrote his first computer program in 1959 and has spent m
 ost of his career at the boundary between hardware and software\, with a p
 articular interest in CPU/software performance interactions. His past work
  includes VAX microcode\, DEC Alpha co-architect\, and inventing the perfo
 rmance counters found in nearly all processors today. He has done low-over
 head microcode and software tracing at DEC\, Adobe\, Google\, and Tesla. D
 r. Sites earned his PhD at Stanford in 1974\; he holds 66 patents and is a
  member of the US National Academy of Engineering.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.
