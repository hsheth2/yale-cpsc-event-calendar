DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJason Weston\, Facebook AI
  & NYU Visiting Research Professor\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nTitle: A jou
 rney from ML and NNs to NLP and Beyond: Just more of the same isn’t enou
 gh?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe first half of the talk will look back on the las
 t two decades of machine learning\, neural network and natural language pr
 ocessing research for dialogue\, through my personal lens\, to discuss the
  advances that have been made and the circumstances in which they happened
  – to try to give clues of what we should be working on for the future. 
 The second half will dive deeper into some current first steps in those fu
 ture directions\, in particular trying to fix the problems of neural gener
 ative models to enable deeper reasoning with short and long-term coherence
 \, and to ground such dialogue agents to an environment where they can act
  and learn. We will argue that just scaling up current techniques\, while 
 a worthy investigation\, will not be enough to solve these problems.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Joohyung Kim\, University of Illinois at Urbana-Ch

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJoohyung Kim\, University o
 f Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nHost: Marynel Vazquez\n\nTitle: Towards 
 Human-Friendly Robots\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe demand for robots which can work
  closely and interact physically with human has been growing. Such robots 
 can already be found guiding\, serving\, and entertaining people in some p
 laces\, such as airports\, restaurants\, and amusement parks. However\, de
 spite advances in related technologies\, there are very few robotic applic
 ations to meet the public’s expectations. To make robots help humans in 
 daily life\, we need better understanding of human evironments and tasks\,
  better methods to perform the tasks through robots\, and better design to
  interact with human naturally and safely. In this talk\, I will present m
 y works and experience to make human-friendly robots by means of robot des
 ign\, motion control\, and human-robot interaction.\n\nBio:\n\nJoohyung Ki
 m is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineeri
 ng in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on 
 design and control for humanoid robots\, system for motion learning in rob
 ot hardware\, and safe human-robot interaction. He received BSE and Ph.D. 
 degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Seoul N
 ational University\, Korea\, in 2001 and 2012. He was with Disney Research
  as a Research Scientist from 2013 to 2019. Prior to joining Disney\, he w
 as a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon Univ
 ersity for DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2013. From 2009 to 2012\, he was a 
 Research Staff Member in Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\, Korea\
 , developing biped walking controllers for humanoid robots.\n\n\nhttps://c
