 till\, Graphics Reporter\nWashington Post\n\nHolly Rushmeier\nis hosting A
 shlyn Still\n\nNews Graphics and Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe media
  landscape is changing rapidly and the tools used for reporting and storyt
 elling are changing with it. New technologies have made data analysis and 
 visualization more accessible for reporters to tell stories in new and dif
 ferent ways. The graphics team at The Washington Post is no exception – 
 they produce award-winning visual storytelling using data\, design\, code\
 , cartography\, illustration\, animation\, augmented reality and more. We
 ’ll take a look at how graphics reporters at The Post are using all of t
 hese methods to enhance their storytelling and better reach audiences in b
 oth the print and digital space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshlyn Still is a graphics
  reporter covering elections and politics at The Washington Post. She spen
 ds most of her time with the elections team\, creating maps\, charts and o
 ther visualizations to bring live election results to audiences on all pla
 tforms. Before joining The Post\, she was a developer on the graphics team
  at Reuters in New York\, focusing on policy\, politics\, economics and la
 bor coverage. She has also worked as a news applications developer at The 
 Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ashlyn graduated from the University of Nort
 h Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism and Mas
 s Communication.\n\nhttps://communications.yale.edu/poynter/ashlyn-still\n
 \n\n\n\n\nThe Poynter Fellowship plays a unique role in the educational li
 fe of Yale University. Nelson Poynter (Yale\, M.A. 1927) established the p
 rogram to enable Yale to bring to its campus distinguished reporters\, edi
 tors and others who have made important contributions to the media.\n\n\n\

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Theo Jepsen

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium - Theo Jepsen\n\nHost: Rober
 t Soulé\n\nTitle: Packet Subscriptions for Programmable ASICs\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nIn this talk\, I explore how programmable data planes can provide a h
 igher-level of service to user applications via a new abstraction called p
 acket subscriptions. Packet subscriptions generalize forwarding rules\, an
 d can be used to express both traditional routing and more esoteric\, cont
 ent-based approaches. We describe a compiler for packet subscriptions that
  uses a novel BDD-based algorithm to efficiently translate predicates into
  P4 tables that can support O(100K) expressions. Using our compiler\, we
 ’ve built a proof-of-concept pub/sub financial application for splitting
  market feeds (e.g.\, Nasdaq’s ITCH protocol) with line-rate message pro
 cessing\, using the full switch bandwidth of 6.5Tbps.\n\nBio:\n\nTheo Jeps
 en received his BA at Cornell University\, Masters at University of Wiscon
 sin Madison\, and is currently in his fourth year of a PhD program at USI\
 , Universita della Svizzera Italiana. His research interests are in in dis
 tributed systems\, networking and programmable data planes.\n
