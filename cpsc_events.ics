DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nDragana Milovančević\n\nHost: 
 Ruzica Piskac\n\nTitle: Proving Equivalence of Functional Programming Assi
 gnments\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk\, we present an automated approach fo
 r verifying the correctness of programming assignments\, such as ones aris
 ing in a functional programming course. Our approach takes a small set of 
 reference solutions and a set of student submissions and checks\, for each
  submission\, whether it is provably correct. A program is considered corr
 ect if it is shown equivalent to a reference solution either directly or i
 ndirectly through some other intermediate solution. We first show how equi
 valence checking automatically matches function calls\, generates inductiv
 e proof attempts and checks them using function unfolding and SMT solving.
  We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practice\, on pr
 ograms drawn from a functional programming course and from the equivalence
  checking literature. Our results show that our system is capable of provi
 ng program correctness by generating inductive equivalence proofs\, as wel
 l as providing counterexamples in case of incorrect implementations\, with
  a high success rate.\n\nBio:\n\nDragana Milovančević is a PhD student 
 in the LARA group at EPFL\, under the supervision of Viktor Kunčak. Previ
 ously\, she received her master’s degree from the University of Belgrade
 \, where she was working as a Teaching Assistant. Her research interests a
 re in the field of formal verification\, where she applies equivalence che
 cking to a variety of domains\, including automated grading.\n\n\nhttps://

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Abhishek Bhattacharjee\, Department of Computer Sc
 ience\, Yale University
DTSTART:20230124T210000
DTEND:20230124T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAbhishek Bhattacharjee\nDep
 artment of Computer Science\, Yale University\n\nTitle: Computer Architect
 ures for Mind-Machine Teaming\n\nAbstract:\n\nDirect brain-computer commun
 ication promises to help treat neurological disorders\, explain brain func
 tion\, and augment human cognition and decision-making. The promise of min
 d-machine teaming hinges on computer systems that delicately balance the t
 ight power\, latency\, and bandwidth trade-offs needed to decode brain act
 ivity\, stimulate biological neurons\, and control assistive devices most 
 effectively.\n\nThis talk presents the design of two systems that unlock s
 everal brain-computer interactions while navigating the power and performa
 nce trade-offs posed by brain interfacing. The first system\, HALO\, is an
  accelerator-rich processing fabric that enables flexible single-brain-sit
 e interfacing at high data rates using only tens of milliwatts of power. T
 he second system\, Hull\, realizes multi-brain-site interfacing using a di
 stributed system of networked accelerator-rich processing fabrics built at
 op HALO. Driven by important brain-computer interface applications (e.g.\,
  epilepsy\, movement disorders\, paralysis)\, we explore systems research 
 questions pertaining to the design and integration of hardware accelerator
 s\, co-design of hardware accelerators with networking & storage stacks\, 
 and clean interfaces/abstractions for programmability. Key insights are un
 dergirded via chip tape-outs in a 12nm CMOS process.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yal

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Ajay Rayasam\, Osage University Partners

DTEND:20230127T180000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium - Ajay Rayasam\, Osage Unive
 rsity Partners\n\nHost: Anurag Khandelwal\n\nIntro to Venture Capital – 
 (aka VC101)\n- Intended for new entrepreneurs\, VC101 has educated many un
 iversity researchers during the past few years on how venture capital work
 s.\n\nThis seminar will help you understand venture capital with respect t
 o entrepreneurship. The seminar will explore these questions:\n\n\nDoes yo
 ur newco have what it takes to secure VC financing?\n\nWho is investing in
  academic startups?\n\nWhat technology sectors are most likely to get fund
 ed?\n\nHow should you and your colleagues approach potential investors?\n\
 nWhen should you seek funding from non-dilutive sources\, family and frien
 ds\, angels\, crowdfunding?\n\nWho should be the CEO?\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.
