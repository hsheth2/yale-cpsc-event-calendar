DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSubhransu Maji\n\nHost: Ste
 ven Zucker\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: Task-specific Recognition
  by Modeling Visual Tasks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe AI revolution powered in par
 t by advances in deep learning has led to many successes in the last decad
 e. I’ll describe some of our work in this vein that has enabled us to in
 fer detailed properties of objects in images such as their 3D structure or
  fine-grained category within a taxonomy\, as well as study ecological phe
 nomena at an unprecedented scale using data collected from RADAR networks.
 \n\nDespite these successes\, the vast majority of important applications 
 remain beyond the scope of current AI systems. One barrier is that existin
 g algorithms lack the ability to learn from limited data. This is a fundam
 ental challenge because real-world data is dynamic\, heavy-tailed\, where 
 supervision can be hard to acquire. I argue that a principled framework fo
 r reasoning about AI problems can enable modular and data-efficient soluti
 ons.\n\nTowards this end I will describe our framework for embedding compu
 ter vision tasks into a vector space that allows us to learn and reason ab
 out their properties. Our approach represents a task as the Fisher informa
 tion of the parameters of a generic “probe” network. We show that the 
 distance between these vectors correlates with natural metrics over tasks.
  It is also predictive of transfer\, i.e.\, how much does training a deep 
 network on one task benefit another\, and can be used for model recommenda
 tion. On a portfolio of hundreds of vision tasks the recommended network u
 sing our approach outperforms the current gold standard of fine-tuning an 
 ImageNet pre-trained network\, especially when training data is limited.\n
 \nI’ll conclude with some of the life-cycle challenges that we need to a
 ddress to make AI systems widely applicable.\n\nBio:\n\nI am an Assistant 
 Professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the Unive
 rsity of Massachusetts Amherst where I co-direct the Computer Vision Lab. 
 I am also affiliated with the Center of Data Science and AWS AI. Prior to 
 this I was a Research Assistant Professor at TTI Chicago\, a philanthropic
 ally endowed academic institute in the University of Chicago campus. I obt
 ained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Be
 rkeley in 2011 and B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Ka
 npur in 2006. For my work\, I have received a Google graduate fellowship\,
  NSF CAREER Award (2018)\, and a best paper honorable mention at CVPR 2018
 . I also serve on the editorial board of the International Journal of Comp
 uter Vision (IJCV).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-subhran

 tration of quantum supremacy by Google is a first step towards the era of 
 small to medium scale quantum computers. In this talk I will explain what 
 the experiment accomplished and the theoretical work it is based on\, as w

 hallenges that remain. I will also describe recent breakthroughs in the 
 design of protocols for the testing and benchmarking of quantum computers
 \, a task that has deep computational and philosophical implications. Sp
 ecifically\, this leads to protocols for scalable and verifiable quantum

 al Studio\n\nAbstract:\n\nHuman life is composed of moments and experience
 s. Imagine going back in time and revisiting crucial moments of your life\
 , such as your wedding ceremony\, or the first birthday of your child\, as
  if you are present at the moment\; Or picture Abraham Lincoln delivering 
 the Gettysburg Address and telling you the story of the American Civil War
 . These phenomena are currently limited to human imagination alone. A comp
 utational machinery that can understand and create a four-dimensional audi
 o-visual world can enable humans to realize their vision and share it with
  others. In this talk\, I will introduce my research on the Computational 
 Studio that allows average humans to relive old memories like a virtual ti
 me travel\, automatically create new experiences\, and express themselves 
 using everyday computational devices audio-visually. In the first part of 
 the talk\, I will describe my work on capturing and browsing 4D audio-visu
 al world and efforts on building a multi-robot capture system. The applica
 tions of this work transcend virtualized reality to digitize intangible cu
 ltural heritage\, capture tribal dances and wildlife in natural environmen
 t\, and understand the social behavior of human beings. I will then presen
 t my research on synthesizing the audio-visual world in an unsupervised ma
 nner. Finally\, I will demonstrate the importance of thinking about a huma
 n user and computational devices when designing content creation applicati
 ons.\n\nBio:\n\nAayush Bansal is a Ph.D. candidate at the Robotics Institu

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSanidhya Kashyap\n\nHost: A
 bhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: Scalable Synch
 ronization Mechanisms for Many-core Operating Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith
  the increasing demand for big data processing\, we have seen tremendous g
 rowth in the adoption and commoditization of many-core machines that span 
 beyond hundreds of hardware threads over the past decade. Even cloud provi
 ders are offering such large machines to allow users to process data as qu
 ickly as possible. To efficiently utilize such resources\, developers rely
  on various synchronization mechanisms as essential building blocks for de
 signing high-performance many-core applications.\n\nIn this talk\, I will 
 focus on designing new synchronization mechanisms for highly concurrent so
 ftware: the operating system. First\, I will show that existing locking pr
 imitives are a big deterrent to the scalability of the operating system. T
 hen\, I will present a new methodology to build scalable and practical loc
 king algorithms that break the decade-old convention of coupling lock’s 
 hardware/software policies and implementation. The family of locks I propo
 se\, not only have the least memory footprint but also the highest through
 put for any thread count. Second\, I will present another scalability prob
 lem that occurs in existing timestamp-based algorithms\, such as concurren
 cy control mechanisms and concurrent data structure frameworks. I will add
 ress this issue with a scalable timestamping primitive by providing an ill
 usion of a global clock\, thereby making such algorithms many-core friendl
 y. Finally\, I will end the talk with my vision for building evolving serv
 ices for operating systems to incorporate the fast-changing hardware as we
 ll as software.\n\nBio:\n\nSanidhya Kashyap is a Ph.D. candidate in the Sc
 hool of Computer Science at Georgia Tech\, advised by Taesoo Kim at Georgi

 stems software. His thesis focuses on revisiting the design of synchroniza
 tion primitives and their impact across software stack. His works have won

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni
 versity and bachelor’s degrees in computer science and in economics from
  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the
  University of Washington as a postdoc. His research interests include hum
 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc
 ience. His work has been covered by many news media outlets\, such as the 
 New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won an NSF CRII award\, a 
 Salesforce research award\, a Facebook fellowship\, and a Yahoo! Key Scien
 tific Challenges award.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-che

 odels perform poorly on tasks that require commonsense reasoning\, which o
 ften necessitates some form of world knowledge or reasoning over informati
 on not immediately present in the input. In the first part of the talk\, I
  will discuss how language models can be leveraged to generate natural lan

 o improve performance on a downstream task such as CommonsenseQA and empir
 ically show that explanations are a way to incorporate commonsense reasoni

 ansferred to other tasks without fine-tuning. In the second part of the ta
 lk\, I will talk about how we can train neural networks to do commonsense 
 reasoning for qualitative physics and demonstrate on simulations involving
  physical laws such as collision\, friction\, and gravity. Our proposed fr

 ng\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: Automated Discovery of Machine Le
 arning Optimizations\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs an increasingly important workload
 \, machine learning (ML) applications require different performance optimi
 zation techniques from traditional runtimes and compilers. In particular\,
  to accelerate ML applications\, it is generally necessary to perform ML c
 omputations on heterogeneous hardware and parallelize computations using m
 ultiple data dimensions\, neither of which is even expressible in traditio
 nal compilers and runtimes. In this talk\, I will describe my work on auto
 mated discovery of performance optimizations to accelerate ML computations
 .\n\nTASO\, the Tensor Algebra SuperOptimizer\, optimizes the computation 
 graphs of deep neural networks (DNNs) by automatically generating potentia
 l graph optimizations and formally verifying their correctness. TASO outpe
 rforms rule-based graph optimizers in existing ML systems (e.g.\, TensorFl
 ow\, TensorRT\, and TVM) by up to 3x by automatically discovering novel gr
 aph optimizations\, while also requiring significantly less human effort.\
 n\nFlexFlow is a system for accelerating distributed DNN training. FlexFlo
 w identifies parallelization dimensions not considered in existing ML syst
 ems (e.g.\, TensorFlow and PyTorch) and automatically discovers fast paral
 lelization strategies for a specific parallel machine. Companies and natio
 nal labs are using FlexFlow to train production ML models that do not scal
 e well in current ML systems\, achieving over 10x performance improvement.
 \n\nI will also outline future research directions for further automating 
 ML systems\, such as codesigning ML models\, software systems\, and hardwa
 re backends for end-to-end ML deployment.\n\nBio:\n\nZhihao Jia is a Ph.D.
  candidate in the Computer Science department at Stanford University worki

  Diagnosis for Distributed Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed software sy
 stems have become the backbone of Internet services. Consequently\, Failur
 es in production distributed systems have severe consequences. A 63-minute
  outage of Amazon in 2018 caused a 100-million loss in revenue. Moreover\,
  the frequency of failures rises with the increasing complexity of softwar
 e systems. 2019 has experienced noticeably more Internet outages and is so
 metimes considered as the “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failur
 es in distributed systems at data center scale is a particularly critical\
 , yet notoriously difficult task because these systems are complex: there 
 are numerous threads\, processes\, and nodes communicating concurrently. E
 xisting diagnosis techniques are either intrusive and incur non-negligible
  performance overhead in a production environment\, or face scalability ch
 allenges when applied to complex software systems.\n\nA promising approach
  is to replicate how developers diagnose these failures. Guided by this no
 tion\, this talk will describe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, wh
 ich automate two major tasks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction an
 d root cause localization. Given the logs and code of a distributed system
  that has failed (in production)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a mi
 nimal set of operations necessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux ca
 n further pinpoint the single instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\

 s Using Programmable Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of d
 ata center network bandwidth\, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU pe
 rformance\, has challenged our conventional wisdom regarding data center n
 etworks: how to build distributed systems that can keep up with the networ
 k speeds and are high-performant and energy-efficient? The recent emergenc
 e of a programmable network fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By
  offloading suitable computations to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, recon
 figurable switch\, or network accelerator)\, one can reduce request servin
 g latency\, save end-host CPU cores\, and enable efficient traffic control
 .\n\nIn this talk\, I will present two frameworks for building PNF-enabled
  distributed systems: (1) IncBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built w
 ith network accelerators and programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-
 based framework for offloading distributed applications on SmartNICs. I wi
 ll show how to make efficient use of in-network heterogeneous computing re
 sources by applying approximation techniques\, co-designing with end-host 
 software layers\, employing new programming abstractions\, and designing e
 fficient control-/data-planes. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to 
 re-architect other data center systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. can
