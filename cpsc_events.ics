DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS/YQI Colloquium - Margaret Martonosi\, P
 rinceton University\n\nHost: Yongshan Ding\n\nTitle: Mind the Gap: Challen
 ges and Opportunities in Closing the Algorithms-to-Devices Gap in Quantum 
 Computing\n\nAbstract:\n\nFrom its initial proposal\, Quantum Computing (Q
 C) has had captivating potential\, and scientists have worked on advancing
  towards that potential.  With well-known algorithms as motivation\, and 
 increasingly capable hardware devices\, QC has now reached an interesting 
 and important inflection point. The Algorithms-to-Devices gap in QC refers
  to the orders of magnitude difference between the quantity and quality of
  resources needed by QC algorithms\, and what has been successfully built 
 today.\n\nWhat is needed now are computer scientists and engineers to deve
 lop the crucial intermediate tool flows\, abstraction layers\, and program
 ming languages that will help QC systems close this gap and reach practica
 l quantum advantage. My talk will offer some recent results from my group 
 about new applications\, compiler\, and architecture approaches for bridgi
 ng the gap. More broadly\, I will advocate for the role that computer scie
 ntists and engineers—particularly architecture and systems researchers 
 — must play in order for QC to reach its full potential.\n\nBio:\n\nMarg
 aret Martonosi is the H.T. Adams ‘35 Professor of Computer Science at Pr
 inceton University\, where she has been on the faculty since 1994. Martono
 si’s research interests are in computer architecture and mobile computin
 g. Her work has included the development of the Wattch power modelling too
 l and the Princeton ZebraNet mobile sensor network project for the design 
 and real-world deployment of zebra tracking collars in Kenya. Her current 
 research focuses on hardware-software interface approaches in both classic
 al and quantum computing systems.\n\nMartonosi is an elected member of the
  US National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and S
 ciences. In 2021\, she received computer architecture’s highest honor\, 
 the ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchly Award\, for contributions to the design\, mode
 ling\, and verification of power-efficient computer architecture. She is a
  Fellow of IEEE and ACM. Her papers have received numerous long-term impac
 t awards in the SIGARCH\, SIGMOBILE\, and other communities. Other notable
  awards include the 2018 IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award
 \, 2010 Princeton University Graduate Mentoring Award\, and the 2019 ACM S
 IGARCH Alan D. Berenbaum Distinguished Service Award. Her work with others
  to co-found the ACM CARES movement was recognized by the Computing Resear
 ch Association’s 2020 Distinguished Service Award.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.y
