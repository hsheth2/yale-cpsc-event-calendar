DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nMing Liu\n\nHost: Anurag Kh
 andelwal\n\nTitle: Building Distributed Systems Using Programmable Network
 s\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of data center network bandwidth
 \, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU performance\, has challenged o
 ur conventional wisdom regarding data center networks: how to build distri
 buted systems that can keep up with the network speeds and are high-perfor
 mant and energy-efficient? The recent emergence of a programmable network 
 fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By offloading suitable computa
 tions to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, reconfigurable switch\, or networ
 k accelerator)\, one can reduce request serving latency\, save end-host CP
 U cores\, and enable efficient traffic control.\n\nIn this talk\, I will p
 resent two frameworks for building PNF-enabled distributed systems: (1) In
 cBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built with network accelerators and
  programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-based framework for offloadi
 ng distributed applications on SmartNICs. I will show how to make efficien
 t use of in-network heterogeneous computing resources by applying approxim
 ation techniques\, co-designing with end-host software layers\, employing 
 new programming abstractions\, and designing efficient control-/data-plane
 s. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to re-architect other data cent
 er systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Paul G. Allen 
 School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington\,
  advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy\, Luis Ceze\, and Simon Peter. His resear
 ch interests are in computer systems and networks\, with a focus on optimi
 zing distributed systems by exploring the computing capabilities across th
 e programmable network fabric (including SmartNICs\, reconfigurable switch
 es\, and network accelerators).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloq
