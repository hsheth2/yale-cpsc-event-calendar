 ed an explosive growth of Internet of things (IoT) devices\, which collect
  or generate huge amounts of data. Given diverse device capabilities and a
 pplication requirements\, data processing takes place across a range of se
 ttings\, from on-device to a nearby edge server/cloud and remote cloud. Co
 nsequently\, edge-cloud coordination has been studied extensively from the
  perspectives of job placement\, scheduling and joint optimization. Typica
 l approaches focus on performance optimization for individual applications
 . This often requires domain knowledge of the applications\, but also lead
 s to application-specific solutions. Application development and deploymen
 t over diverse scenarios thus incur repetitive manual efforts.\n\nThere ar
 e two overarching challenges to provide system-level support for applicati
 on development at the edge. First\, there is inherent heterogeneity at the
  device hardware level. The execution settings may range from a small clus
 ter as an edge cloud to on-device inference on embedded devices\, differin
 g in hardware capability and programming environments. Further\, applicati
 on performance requirements vary significantly\, making it even more diffi
 cult to map different applications to already heterogeneous hardware. Sec
 ond\, there are trends towards incorporating edge and cloud and multi-moda
 l data. Together\, these add further dimensions to the design space and i
 ncrease the complexity significantly.\n\nIn this thesis\, we propose a nov
 el framework to simplify application development and deployment over a con
 tinuum of edge to cloud. Our framework provides key connections between di
 fferent dimensions of design considerations\, corresponding to the applica
 tion abstraction\, data abstraction and resource management abstraction re
 spectively.\n\nFirst\, our framework masks hardware heterogeneity with abs
 tract resource types through containerization\, and abstracts away the app
 lication processing pipelines into generic flow graphs. Further\, our fram
 ework further supports a notion of degradable computing for application sc
 enarios at the edge that are involved with multimodal sensory input. Next\
 , we include a generic data management service between video query systems
  and a video store to organize video data at the edge. We propose a video 
 data unit abstraction based on a notion of distance between objects in the
  video\, quantifying the semantic similarity among video data. Last\, cons
 idering concurrent application execution\, our framework supports multi-ap
 plication offloading with device-centric control\, with a system-level sch
 eduler service that wraps over the operating system scheduler.\n\n\nhttps:
