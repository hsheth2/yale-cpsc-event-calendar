DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n\n\nCS Talk\nQuanquan Liu\n\nHost: Holly R
 ushmeier\n\nTitle: Scalable Graph Algorithms: Parallel\, Dynamic\, and Pri
 vate\n\nAbstract:\n\nGraph algorithms are ubiquitous in today’s world wh
 ere graph analytics are performed over massive datasets containing potenti
 ally sensitive information. Modern graphs present many new challenges not 
 considered by classic static\, sequential computation models. First\, grap
 hs have up to trillions of edges and are several orders of magnitude large
 r than what traditional sequential algorithms can handle. In addition to s
 cale\, modern graphs are also dynamically evolving with up to millions of 
 changes per second. Second\, data leaks and commercial data trading threat
 en to expose the large volume of sensitive private information contained i
 n these graphs. Third\, the monetary and resource incentives associated wi
 th large distributed graphs (e.g.\, for cryptocurrency) make them vulnerab
 le to malicious adversaries. Thus\, modern graph algorithms must achieve s
 everal simultaneous goals: efficiency\, scalability\, privacy\, and robust
 ness against adversaries.\n\nIn this talk\, I will present algorithms that
  rise to these aforementioned challenges. I will first present novel scala
 ble algorithms for k-core decomposition and related important problems in 
 computational models that take advantage of modern parallel computing arch
 itectures and dynamic environments. These algorithms not only achieve theo
 retical improvements but also hundreds of times speedups over the state-of
 -the-art in practice. Then\, I will formalize models and give algorithms t
 hat combat broader societal concerns of privacy breaches and susceptibilit
 y to adversarial attacks. Finally\, I’ll discuss my broader research vis
 ion in combining scalability with adversary-robustness.\n\nBio:\n\nQuanqua

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Lauren F. Klein\, Emory University
DTSTART:20230330T143000
DTEND:20230330T153000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nLauren F. Klein\, Emory Uni
 versity\n\nHost: Holly Rushmeier\n\nTitle: Why LLM Research Needs Feminism
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leverage
 d by corporations and in academic research\, the asymmetrical conditions o
 f their production\, the expanding possibilities for their application\, a
 nd their potential for harm—to both people and the planet—are becoming
  increasingly difficult to ignore. How should we think about these possibi
 lities and pitfalls? Who should we be thinking with? And what should we be
  thinking about? In this talk\, Klein will propose that\nintersectional fe
 minism\ncan help to answer these consequential questions—and potentially
  point the way to new areas of AI/ML research. Drawing from her recent boo
 k\,\nData Feminism\n(MIT Press\, 2020)\, co-authored with Catherine D’Ig
 nazio\, and her longstanding involvement in work at the intersection of NL
 P and humanities data\, she will demonstrate how the attention to asymmetr
 ical power that constitutes the core of feminist thinking can not only be 
 translated into the LLM research space\, but is in fact necessary if these
  models are to contribute to some of today’s most urgent research questi
 ons—those having to do with increasing social and cultural understanding
 \, and limiting the potential for bias and harm.\n\nBio:\n\nLauren Klein i
 s Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the 
 departments of English and Quantitative Theory & Methods at Emory Universi
 ty\, where she also directs the\nDigital Humanities Lab\n. Before moving t
 o Emory\, she taught in the School of Literature\, Media\, and Communicati
 on at Georgia Tech. Klein works at the intersection of digital humanities
 \, data science\, and American culture\, with a research focus on issues 
 of gender and race. She is the author of several books\, including the aw
 ard-winning\nData Feminism\n(MIT Press\, 2020)\, co-authored with Catherin
 e D’Ignazio. With Matthew K. Gold\, she edits\nDebates in the Digital H
 umanities\n\,\na hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores deb
 ates in the field as they emerge. Her work has appeared in leading humanit

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nFatemeh Nargesian\n\nHost: Anurag
  Khandelwal\n\nTitle: Data Lakes: Discovery\, Data Debiasing\, and Query A
 nswering\n\nAbstract:\n\nData for AI is increasingly reliant on the integr
 ation of multiple sources – sometimes obtained from open data repositori
 es or data marketplaces. Despite decades of research in data integration a
 nd cleaning\, we are still not sure how to construct AI-ready structured d
 atasets – data with descriptive features and representative distribution
 . In this talk\, first\, I will describe how to discover relevant datasets
 \, based on join and union operations from large-scale data repositories\,
  by designing efficient index structures. Next\, I will show how to tailor
  a dataset with desired distribution requirements from multiple sources\, 
 in order to construct unbiased datasets. We will also see how to obtain an
  IID sample over normalized data\, to improve the efficiency of model trai
 ning and perform approximate query answering. Finally\, I will conclude by
  discussing distribution-aware and human-centric aspects of the management
  of data lakes.\n\nBio:\n\nFatemeh Nargesian is an assistant professor of 
 computer science at the University of Rochester. She obtained her PhD at t
 he University of Toronto. Her research interests are in data management fo
 r AI-based data analytics and scientific time-series management. Her work 
 has appeared at top-tier venues including VLDB\, SIGMOD\, and ICDE\, and h
 as won the best demo award of VLDB 2017.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/

 n\nTitle: Towards a Statistical Foundation for Reinforcement Learning\n\n
 Abstract:\n\nIn recent years\, reinforcement learning algorithms have achi
 eved a number of headline-grabbing empirical successes on various complex 
 tasks. However\, applying the reinforcement learning paradigm to new probl
 ems remains highly challenging. In many cases\, the existing algorithms ne
 ed to be modified\, and new ones may have to be developed to solve the pro
 blem at hand. In order to do so effectively\, we must gain some understand
 ing about the foundations of reinforcement learning.\n\nIn this talk I wil
 l present some recent results of my research towards this goal. I will fir
 st present an algorithm that can exploit the domain structure to learn muc
 h faster on easier problems\, while retaining state-of-the art worst-case 
 guarantees on pathologically hard ones.  Then I will discuss a fundamenta
 l information-theoretic lower-bound\, which establishes that reinforcement
  learning can be exponentially harder than supervised learning even when s
 imple linear predictors are implemented. Finally\, I will discuss a stati
 stically optimal algorithm to learn from historical data.\n\nBio:\n\nAndr
 ea Zanette is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Electrical Engin
 eering and Computer Sciences at the University of California\, Berkeley\, 
 supported by a fellowship from the Foundation of Data Science Institute. 
 He completed his PhD (2017-2021) in the Institute for Computational and Ma
 thematical Engineering at Stanford University\, advised by Prof Emma Bruns
 kill and Mykel J. Kochenderfer. His PhD dissertation investigated modern 
 Reinforcement Learning challenges such as exploration\, function approxima
 tion\, adaptivity\, and learning from offline data. His work was supported
  by a Total Innovation Fellowship and his PhD thesis was awarded the Gene
  Golub Outstanding Dissertation Award from his department. Andrea’s back
 ground is in mechanical engineering. Before Stanford\, he worked as a soft
 ware developer in high-performance computing\, as well as at the von Karma

 \n\nTitle: Robust and Equitable Uncertainty Estimation\n\nAbstract:\n\nMac
 hine learning provides us with an amazing set of tools to make predictions
 \, but how much should we trust particular predictions? To answer this\, w
 e need a way of estimating the confidence we should have in particular pre
 dictions of black-box models. Standard tools for doing this give guarantee
 s that are averages over predictions. For instance\, in a medical applicat
 ion\, such tools might paper over poor performance on one medically releva
 nt demographic group if it is made up for by higher performance on another
  group. Standard methods also depend on the data distribution being static
  — in other words\, the future should be like the past.\n\nIn this talk\
 , I will describe new techniques to address both these problems: a way to 
 produce prediction sets for arbitrary black-box prediction methods that ha
 ve correct empirical coverage even when the data distribution might change
  in arbitrary\, unanticipated ways and such that we have correct coverage 
 even when we zoom in to focus on demographic groups that can be arbitrary 
 and intersecting. When we just want correct group-wise coverage and are wi
 lling to assume that the future will look like the past\, our algorithms a
 re especially simple. We draw on ideas and techniques from the economic li
 teratures on calibration\, expert testing\, and property elicitation\, as 
 well as recent work in algorithmic fairness.\n\nThis talk is based on four
  papers that are joint works with Osbert Bastani\, Varun Gupta\, Changhwa 
 Lee\, Chris Jung\, Mallesh Pai\, Georgy Noarov\, Ramya Ramalingam\, and Ra
 kesh Vohra.\n\nBio:\n\nAaron Roth is the Henry Salvatori Professor of Comp
 uter and Cognitive Science\, in the Computer and Information Sciences depa
 rtment at the University of Pennsylvania\, with a secondary appointment in
  the Wharton statistics department. He is affiliated with the Warren Cente

 al Systems Engineering (NETS) program.  He is also an Amazon Scholar at A
 mazon AWS. He is the recipient of a Presidential Early Career Award for Sc
 ientists and Engineers (PECASE) awarded by President Obama in 2016\, an Al
 fred P. Sloan Research Fellowship\, an NSF CAREER award\, and research awa
 rds from Yahoo\, Amazon\, and Google.  His research focuses on the algori
 thmic foundations of data privacy\, algorithmic fairness\, game theory\, l
 earning theory\, and machine learning.  Together with Cynthia Dwork\, he 
 is the author of the book “The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential P
 rivacy.” Together with Michael Kearns\, he is the author of “The Ethic
