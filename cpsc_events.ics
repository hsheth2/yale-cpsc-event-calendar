DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nZhiyun Qian\, University of
  California Riverside\n\nTitle: Weaponizing Network Side Channels: From T
 CP Hijacking to DNS Cache Poisoning\n\nHost: Charalampos (Babis) Papamanth
 ou\n\nAbstract:\n\nSide channel attacks were never considered as part of t
 he threat model when network protocols were designed. Even today\, the imp
 act of network side channels is vastly underestimated. Exploiting network 
 side channels have been considered challenging\, if not infeasible\, due t
 o its nature of being remote. In this talk\, I will demonstrate a series o
 f surprisingly powerful attacks where a blind off-path attacker can use si
 de channels to hijack arbitrary remote TCP connections\, as well as launch
  DNS cache poisoning attacks against popular DNS services. I will also giv
 e insights on how to systematically discover such problems.\n\nBio:\n\nZhi
 yun Qian\nis the Everett and Imogene Ross associate professor in the CSE d
 epartment at the University of California Riverside. His main research int
 erests are in the area of system and network security\, including vulnerab
 ility discovery\, side channel analysis\, applied program analysis\, syst
 em building\, and measurement of real-world security problems. He is a rec
 ipient of the ACM CCS distinguished paper award in 2020\, Applied Networki
 ng Research Prize from IRTF in 2019\, NSF CAREER Award in 2017\, Facebook 
 Internet Defense Prize Finalist in 2016\, and the most creative idea award
  from Geekpwn 2016.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-zhiyun-
