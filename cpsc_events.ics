DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nSpeaker:\nVoicu Popescu\n\, Purdu
 e University\n\nTitle: Image Generalization Through Camera Model Design\n\
 nHost: Holly Rushmeier\n\nAbstract:\n\nMost computer graphics and visualiz
 ation applications rely on images rendered with the planar pinhole camera\
 , which approximates the human eye. Whereas for some applications it is im
 portant to generate images that closely resemble what users would actually
  see if they explored a physical replica of the dataset\, for many other a
 pplications the constraints of the planar pinhole camera are unnecessarily
  restrictive. In this talk we give an overview of our work to remove the u
 niform sampling rate and the single viewpoint constraints of conventional 
 images. The image generalization is implemented through an intervention at
  the camera model level. We present the camera model design paradigm that 
 abandons the conventional rigidity of the camera model in favor of designi
 ng and optimizing the camera model for each application\, for each dataset
 \, and for each view. The resulting generalized image is more effective th
 an a conventional image\, yet it remains easy to compute\, continuous\, an
 d non-redundant. We illustrate the benefits of image generalization in a w
 ide range of applications such as focus+context\, remote\, and multiperspe
 ctive visualization\, visibility computation\, rendering acceleration\, vi
 rtual and augmented reality navigation\, and diminished reality.\n\nBio:\n

SUMMARY:Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science CBDS Seminar Series “Tow
 ards Broad and Robust AI” - Irina Rish\, Quebec AI Institute
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201007T200000

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYale Center for Biomedical Data Science\nC
 BDS Seminar Series “Towards Broad and Robust AI”\n\nSpeaker:\nIrina Ri
 sh\, PhD\nComputer Science and Operations Research Department\nUniversité
  de Montréal (UdeM) and Core Member of MILA - Quebec AI Institute\n\nZoom
 :\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/92067328444\n\nAbstract:\n\nModern AI systems ha
 ve achieved impressive results in many specific domains\, from image and s
 peech recognition to natural language processing and mastering complex gam
 es such as chess and Go. However\, they remain largely inflexible\, fragil
 e and narrow\, unable to continually adapt to a wide range of changing env
 ironments and novel tasks without “catastrophically forgetting” what t
 hey have learned before\, to infer higher-order abstractions allowing for 
 systematic generalization to out-of-distribution data\, and to achieve the
  level of robustness necessary to “survive” various perturbations in t
 heir environment - a natural property of most biological intelligent syste
 ms. In this talk\, we will provide a brief overview of several recent adva
 nces in continual learning (CL) which aim to push AI from “narrow” to 
 “broad”\, including unsupervised architectural adaptations inspired by
  adult neurogenesis in mammalian brains [1]\; transfer/interference trade-
 off approaches enforcing gradient alignment across examples\, and combinin
 g experience replay with optimization- based meta-learning [2]\, as well a
 s recently proposed CL framework for quickly solving new\, out-of-distribu
 tion tasks\, while also allowing for fast remembering of the previous ones
  [3]. The latter framework unifies continual-\, meta-\, meta-continual-\, 
 and continual-meta learning and introduces continual-MAML\, an online exte
 nsion of the popular MAML algorithm. We also address the robust representa
 tion learning problem\, i.e. extracting features invariant to various stoc
 hastic and/or adversarial perturbations of theenvironment - a common goal 
 across continual-\, meta-\, transfer learning as well as adversarial robus
 tness\, out-of-distribution generalization\, self-supervised learning\, an
 d related subfields. As an example\, our  recent Adversarial Feature Dese
 nsitization (AFD) approach [4] trains a feature extractor network to gener
 ate representations which are both predictive and robust to input perturba
 tions (e.g. adversarial attacks) and demonstrates a significant improvemen
 t over the state-of-the-art\, despite its relative simplicity (i.e.\, feat
 ure robustness is enforced via additional adversarial decoder with a GAN-l
 ike objective attempting to discriminate between the original and perturbe
 d inputs). Finally\, we conclude the talk with a discussion of several dir
 ections for future work\, which including drawing inspirations from neuros
 cience\, to develop truly broad and robust AI systems capable of continual
 \, lifelong learning.\n\nBio:\n\nIrina Rish is an Associate Professor in t
 he Computer Science and Operations Research department at the Université 
 de Montréal (UdeM) and a core member of MILA - Quebec AI Institute. She h
 olds MSc and PhD in AI from University of California\, Irvine and MSc in A
 pplied Mathematics from Moscow Gubkin Institute. Dr. Rish’s research foc
 us is on machine learning\, neural data analysis and neuroscience-inspired
  AI. Her current research interests include continual lifelong learning\, 
 optimization algorithms for deep neural networks\, sparse modeling and pro
 babilistic inference\, dialog generation\, biologically plausible reinforc
 ement learning\, and dynamical systems approaches to brain imaging analysi
 s. Before joining UdeM and MILA in 2019\, Irina was a research scientist a
 t the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center\, where she worked on various projec
 ts at the intersection of neuroscience and AI\, and led the Neuro-AI chall
 enge. She received multiple IBM awards\, including IBM Eminence & Excellen

 \, Eugene Higgins Professor of Computer Science\, Princeton\n\nTitle: Bui
 lding an Algorithmic Toolkit for Out-of-Equilibrium Systems\n\nHost:\nNish
 eeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAlgorithms research has long been preoccupi
 ed with systems that reach equilibrium: random processes should converge t
 o stationary distributions\; dynamical systems should be attracting or\, a
 t worst\, periodic\; algorithms should terminate and land in a “good” 
 place\; etc. Natural algorithms\, those found in nature\, break all of the
 se rules. What are we to do then? Answer: Build new algorithmic tools. I w
 ill sketch some of my efforts in that direction. The talk will be aimed at
  a general scientific audience and will require no background knowledge.\n
 \n\n\nBio:\nBernard Chazelle (graduate of École des Mines de Paris\, PhD 
 Yale) has been professor at Princeton University since 1986\, where he hol
 ds the Eugene Higgins chair in Computer Science.\n\nAs Director of the NSF
  Center for Computational Intractability\, his research focuses on algorit
 hms and complexity. He has been a visiting professor at École Normale Sup
 érieure (ENS) Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, University of Paris-Sud\, and 
 INRIA. He spent many years as a consultant for Xerox PARC\, DEC SRC\, NEC 
 Research\, (where he chaired the Board of Fellows) and Tsinghua University
  in Beijing. He is\, or was\, member of the Scientific Committee at ENS Ul
 m\, École Polytechnique\, and the Institut Henri Poincaré. He is also a 
 member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the European Acade
 my of Sciences\, ACM Fellow\, Guggenheim Fellow\, and winner of several aw
 ards from the SIAM mathematical society.\n\nA pioneering figure in computa
 tional geometry\, Bernard Chazelle is known for his resolution of a number
  of longstanding open questions in the field. His research has also led hi
 m to investigate the role of randomness in computing\, a subject he took u
 p in his book\, The Discrepancy Method: Randomness and Complexity. In the 
 last few years\, his efforts have focused on “natural algorithms\,” wi
 th the aim of building a bridge between dynamical systems and algorithms f
 rom the living world. Professor Chazelle takes pride in having taught the 
 very first “Integrated Science” program at Princeton University\, toge
 ther with colleagues from physics and biology.\n\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yal

 int event with YINS)\n\nSpeaker :\nChristos Papdimitriou\n\, Columbia Uni
 versity\n\nTitle: “Language\, Brain\, and Computation”\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nHow does the brain beget the mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapse
 s effect reasoning\, intelligence\, language?   Despite dazzling progres
 s in experimental neuroscience\, as well as in cognitive science at the ot
 her extreme of scale\, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarc
 hing question – the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to b
 e required.  As Richard Axel recently put it:  “We don’t have a logi
 c for the transformation of neural activity into thought […].”\n\nWhat
  kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?\n\nI will introd
 uce a computational system whose basic data structure is the assembly – 
 assemblies are large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\
 , thoughts\, etc. –\, and which is informed by recent progress in unders
 tanding how language happens in the brain.\n\nBio:\n\nChristos Harilaos Pa
 padimitriou is the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbi
 a University.  Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor at UC
  Berkeley for the previous 22 years\, and before that he taught at Harvard
 \, MIT\, NTU Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five textbooks
  and many articles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applications t
 o optimization\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics and game 
 theory\, the Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a PhD from P
 rinceton (1976)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member of the N
 ational Academy of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of Arts and S
 ciences\, and the National Academy of Engineering\, and he has received th
 e Knuth prize\, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as well as th
 e 2018 Harvey Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the Hellenic r
 epublic named him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He has also wri
 tten three novels: “Turing \,” “Logicomix”  and his latest “Ind
 ependence.”\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-distinguished-colloquium
