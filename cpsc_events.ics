DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nArman Cohan\n\nTitle: Adapt
 ing Transformer models for Document-level Natural Language Tasks\n\nHost: 
 Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nTransformer models have been extremely effe
 ctive at producing word- and sentence-level contextualized representations
 \, achieving state-of-the-art results in many Natural Language Processing 
 (NLP) tasks. However\, extending these models to document-level NLP tasks 
 faces challenges\, including lack of inter-document relatedness informatio
 n\, decreased performance in low-resource settings\, and computational ine
 fficiency when scaling to long documents.\n\nIn this talk\, I will describ
 e a few of my recent works on developing Transformer-based models that tar
 get document-level natural language tasks. I will first introduce SPECTER\
 , a method for producing document representations using a Transformer mode
 l that incorporates document-level relatedness signals and achieves state-
 of-the-art results in multiple document-level tasks in the scientific doma
 in.  Second\, I will describe TLDR\, the task of extreme summarization fo
 r scientific papers as well as CATTs\, a simple yet effective training str
 ategy for generating summaries in low-resource settings. Next\, I will dis
 cuss the practical challenges of scaling existing Transformer models to lo
 ng documents\, and our proposed solution\, Longformer. Longformer\, introd
 uces a new sparse self-attention pattern that scales linearly with the inp
 ut length while capturing both local and global context in the document\, 
 achieving state-of-the-art results in both character-level language modeli
 ng and document NLP tasks. Finally\, I’ll discuss CDLM\, our newly propo
 sed general pre-trained model for addressing multi-document tasks.\n\nBio:

 visor: Dragomir Radev\n\nOther committee members:\n\nRobert Frank\nMaryne
 l Vazquez\nKathleen McKeown (Columbia University)\nLuke Zettlemoyer (Unive
 rsity of Washington)\n\nAbstract:\n\nNatural language is a fundamental for
 m of information and communication and will be the next frontier in comput
 er interfaces. Natural Language Interfaces (NLI) bridge the data and the u
 ser\, significantly promoting the possibility and efficiency of informatio
 n access for many users besides data experts. All consumer-facing software
  will one day have a dialogue interface\, the next vital leap in the evolu
 tion of search engines. Such intelligent dialogue systems should be able t
 o understand the meaning of language grounded in various contexts and gene
 rate effective language responses in different forms for information reque
 sts and human-computer communication. In particular\, this dissertation fo
 cuses on answering the following three questions: 1) How can NLI ground hu
 man requests in natural language into formal programs (e.g.\, SQL)? 2) How
  can NLI converse with humans in a robust manner? 3) How can neural models
  understand compositionality in human language?\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu

 or Decentralize? Balancing Trust and Performance in Decentralized Systems\
 n\nHost: Zhong Shao\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn recent years\, cryptocurrencies and
  blockchains have received widespread attention. These systems are general
 ly designed to be decentralized in order to reduce the required trust assu
 mptions as much as possible. However\, there are choices to be made about 
 how much to trust and how much to decentralize which in turn greatly affec
 t the properties that can be achieved efficiently.\n\nIn this talk\, I wil
 l discuss how these choices can be leveraged for large performance gains a
 nd to achieve new properties in smart contract systems and for privacy-pre
 serving cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nIn particular\, I will show how sm
 art contract scalability can be improved by executing contracts in smaller
  committees\, while at the same time allowing safe interaction between unt
 rusted contracts. Further\, I will show how lightweight blockchain clients
  for fully anonymous cryptocurrencies can be enabled efficiently\, and how
  privacy and accountability can be balanced in central bank digital curren
 cies.\n\nBio:\n\nKarl Wüst is a PhD Candidate in the System Security Grou
 p at ETH Zurich. His research focuses on the security and privacy of block
 chain technology with a particular focus on smart contract scalability and
  central bank cryptocurrencies. In his research\, he combines techniques f
 rom cryptography\, distributed systems\, and trusted computing to balance 
 the trade-off between reducing trust and achieving high performance. His r
 esearch has been published at top venues in security (CCS\, Usenix Securit
 y\, NDSS) and resulted in multiple patent applications.\n\n*Contact\nAlici

 itle: The Manifold of Neural Responses Informs Physiological Circuits in M
 ouse Visual System\n\nAdvisor: Steven Zucker\n\nOther committee members:\n
 \nJulie Dorsey\nRonald Coifman\nMichael Stryker (UCSF)\n\nAbstract:\n\nInf
 erring the structure and function of neural circuits is central to underst
 anding biological visual systems. Focusing on the visual system of the mou
 se\, we address two major challenges toward this goal. First\, we introduc
 e a novel stimulus ensemble. We show that it is rich enough to exercise th
 e visual system broadly but simple enough for analysis.  The ensemble inc
 ludes flow patterns\, a class of naturalistic visual stimuli that span spa
 tial frequency\, contrast\, orientation and directionality\, as well as co
 nventional grating stimuli. These flow stimuli are more constrained than n
 atural images but more variable than gratings and noise patterns. A stimul
 us generator is developed\, and it has been deployed in several neuroscien
 ce laboratories.\n\nThe second challenge is how to infer the functional st
 ructure of neural circuits from their activity to the stimulus ensemble. W
 e use machine learning techniques to develop a novel manifold of neurons. 
 This manifold is informative of basic circuit topology as well as neural f
 unction. It differs from the standard approach in which trials are embedde
 d in ‘neural coordinates.’ Our manifold\, by contrast\, embeds neurons
  in functional coordinates derived from the stimuli. It is defined so that
  those neurons that are close to one another on the manifold respond simil
 arly in both activity and time to similar features within the stimulus ens
 emble.\n\nPreliminary experiments with mouse retina and visual cortex data
  reveal examples of these different manifold structures and provide a foun
 dation for understanding the computational transition between retina and c
 ortex in awake\, behaving mice. The same algorithm can be applied to artif
 icial neural networks as well\; interestingly\, deep CNNs yield manifolds 
 that are disconnected like the retina\, not continuous like V1. For neuros
 cience\, this could explain the apparent ceiling in modeling cortical data
 \; the limitations of categorical tasks\; and suggests future modeling dir
 ections. More generally\, it illuminates limitations on the categorization
  problem\, and underlines the importance of recurrence in networks for mor
 e complex tasks.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-luc

 Perception and Decision-Making Systems for Human-Robot Teaming in Safety-C
 ritical Environments\n\nHost: Brian Scassellati\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this ta
 lk\, I will present my current and future work on developing perception an
 d decision making systems that enable robots to team with groups of people
 . My core focus is on problems that robots encounter in human-robot teamin
 g\, including perceptions of human groups and social navigation\, particul
 arly in safety-critical environments.\n\nFirst\, I will discuss how I deve
 loped computer vision methods that enable robots to detect and track their
  teammates in real-world environments. Most group perception methods emplo
 y fixed\, overhead cameras (i.e.\, an exo-centric / third-person perspecti
 ve) to sense groups of people\, rendering them impractical for mobile robo
 ts working in most settings. I have developed a group detection and tracki
 ng system designed for ego-centric (i.e.\, first-person) perspective sensi
 ng\, which is more suitable for mobile robots\, to enable them to enter an
 y environment and accomplish their goals without external sensing requirem
 ents.\n\nNext\, I will discuss this work contextualized within a real-worl
 d application: human-robot teaming in healthcare. I am developing systems 
 for hospital Emergency Departments (ED)\, where frontline healthcare worke
 rs have been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. I will describe my work
  characterizing ED care delivery and staff workflow to enable robots to op
 erate in these challenging environments. Building on this\, I designed a s
 ocial navigation system that enables robots to incorporate the severity of
  patients’ health while navigating in the ED\, to prevent interruptions 
 in care delivery. My work will enable robots to work in safety-critical\, 
 human-centered environments\, and ultimately help improve patient outcomes
  and alleviate clinician workload.\n\nBio:\n\nAngelique Taylor is a Ph.D.

 h lies at the intersection of computer vision\, robotics\, and health info
 rmatics. She develops systems that enable robots to interact and work with
  groups of people in safety-critical environments. She has received the NS

 tizing Computation and Analyst Resources in Large-scale Data Analytics\n\n
 Host: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nAbstract:\n\nData volumes are growing expo
 nentially\, fueled by an increased number of automated processes such as s
 ensors and devices. Meanwhile\, the computational power available for proc
 essing this data – as well as analysts’ ability to interpret it – re
 main limited. As a result\, database systems must evolve to address these 
 new bottlenecks in analytics. In my work\, I ask: how can we adapt classic
  ideas from database query processing to modern compute- and analyst-limit
 ed data analytics?\n\nIn this talk\, I will discuss the potential for this
  kind of systems development through the lens of several practical systems
  I have developed. By drawing insights from database query optimization\, 
 such as pushing workload- and domain-specific filtering\, aggregation\, an
 d sampling into core analytics workflows\, we can dramatically improve the
  efficiency of analytics at scale. I will illustrate these ideas by focusi
 ng on two systems — one designed to optimize visualizations for streamin
 g infrastructure and application telemetry and one designed for high-volum
 e seismic waveform analysis — both of which have been field-tested at sc
 ale. I will also discuss lessons from production deployments at companies 
 including Datadog\, Microsoft\, Google and Facebook.\n\nBio:\n\nKexin Rong

 hitecting Quantum Computing Systems in the Presence of Noise\n\nHost: Lin 
 Zhong\n\nAbstract:\n\nQuantum computers may solve some problems beyond the
  reach of classical digital computers. However\, emerging quantum systems 
 are typically noisy and difficult to control\, leaving a significant gap b
 etween the exacting requirements of quantum applications and the realities
  of noisy devices. Bridging this gap is crucial – my work adapts convent
 ional computer systems techniques to meet the critical theoretical and exp
 erimental constraints in quantum processors. I divide my talk into three p
 arts: (i) introducing my recent work on systematic noise mitigation for su
 perconducting transmon qubits [MICRO’20]\, which enhances the robustness
  of quantum processors through coordination of control instructions\; (ii)
  demonstrating efficient and reliable quantum memory management [ISCA’20
 ]\, which implements automated tools for allocation\, reclamation and reus
 e of qubits in quantum programs\, much like in garbage collection for clas
 sical programs\; (iii) discussing on-going work on implementing quasi-faul
 t-tolerant rotation gates in quantum error correction\, which seeks to pro
 vide correctness guarantees for quantum applications by encoding quantum b
 its in a way that errors can be detected and corrected\, analogous to clas
 sical error-correcting codes.\n\nBio:\n\nYongshan Ding is a Ph.D. candidat

 Building secure distributed systems atop the insecure Internet\n\nHost: An
 urag Khandelwal\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed systems are increasingly impor
 tant for our everyday life\, allowing for high performance\, fault toleran
 ce\, and flexibility. Many of these systems nowadays rely on the inherentl
 y insecure Internet infrastructure. Surely though\, they should have been 
 designed to take this into account…?\n\nIn this talk\, I will answer neg
 atively to this question using a concrete example: public blockchain syste
 ms such as Bitcoin. These are novel distributed systems that are designed 
 according to stringent failure models. In this context\, I will explain ho
 w an adversary controlling pieces of Internet infrastructure can practical
 ly compromise: (i) Bitcoin’s consensus protocol (by partitioning the net
 work)\; (ii) Bitcoin’s anonymity guarantees (by mapping pseudonyms to re
 al-world identities)\; and (iii) Bitcoin’s availability (by eclipsing cl
 ients).\n\nWhile these attacks are worrying\, I will also introduce practi
 cal and effective defenses to counter them both at the network and the app
 lication layer. Beyond Bitcoin\, this work teaches essential lessons for d
 istributed-system design.\n\nBio:\n\nMaria Apostolaki is a PhD Student at

  Safety and Buffer Overflow Lecture\n\nHost: Holly Rushmeier\n\nAbstract:\
 n\nMemory safety is a concept of protecting the memory and data of program
 s. Because memory safety is closely related to the integrity of the data\,
  it is paramount for developing safe and secure software. Memory safety er
 rors can occur when an unallocated region of memory is accessed or when me
 mory is accessed using methods that cause undefined behaviors. In this lec
 ture\, we will discuss about the various causes and consequences of memory
  safety error as well as techniques to prevent them. We will then focus on
  a particular class of memory safety known as buffer overflow error and it
 s implication in data integrity.\n\nThis lecture is designed for students 
 who have some experiences in programming in C language. In particular\, kn
 owledge in the interactions between pointers\, arrays\, and dynamic alloca
 tion of memory is paramount for the lecture. Understanding the basics of s
 tack and heap memory region is recommended\, and usually taught in previou
 s lectures.\n\nBio:\n\nJay P. Lim is a seventh year Ph.D. Student at Rutge

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nDanfei Xu\n\nTitle: Composi
 tional Reasoning in Robot Learning\n\nHost: Steven Zucker\n\nAbstract:\n\n
 To carry out diverse tasks in everyday human environments\, future robots 
 must generalize beyond the knowledge they are equipped with. However\, des
 pite recent  advances in “end-to-end” deep learning\, today’s robot
  learning methods are still limited to specializing in one task at a time.
  At the same time\, humans perform everyday tasks with ease. But instead o
 f learning each task in silos\, we distill reusable abstractions from our 
 daily experiences and solve new tasks by composing known building blocks. 
 Such\ncompositional reasoning\ncapability is crucial for developing future
  robots that are both competent and versatile.\n\nIn this talk\, I will pr
 esent my works on building compositional reasoning capabilities into robot
  learning systems. I will start by showing that imposing strong compositio
 nal structures (e.g.\, programs\, graphs) on end-to-end robot learning app
 roaches enables systematic generalization across long-horizon object manip
 ulation tasks. Then I will present our recent efforts to relax the structu
 ral assumptions in order to bring compositional reasoning closer to real-w
 orld settings: learning from unstructured human demonstrations and learnin
 g through trial-and-error.\n\nBio:\n\nDanfei Xu is a final-year Ph.D. stud
 ent at Stanford University advised by Fei-Fei Li and Silvio Savarese. His 
 research lies in the intersection of robotics\, computer vision\, and mach
 ine learning. His research goal is to build autonomous agents that can ope
 rate in everyday human environments. He obtained a B.S. from Columbia Univ

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nRanjay Krishna\n\nTitle: Vi
 sual Intelligence from Human Learning\n\nHost: Marynel Vázquez\n\nAbstrac
 t:\n\nAt the core of human development is the ability to adapt to new\, pr
 eviously unseen stimuli. We comprehend new situations as a composition of 
 previously seen information and ask one another for clarification when we 
 encounter new concepts. Yet\, this ability to go beyond the confounds of t
 heir training data remains an open challenge for artificial intelligence a
 gents. My research designs visual intelligence to reason over new composit
 ions and acquire new concepts. My talk will explore these challenges and p
 resent the two following lines of work:\n\nFirst\, I will introduce scene 
 graphs\, a cognitively-grounded\, compositional visual representation. I w
 ill discuss how to integrate scene graphs into a variety of computer visio
 n tasks\, enabling models to generalize to novel compositions from a few t
 raining examples. Since our introduction of scene graphs\, the Computer Vi
 sion community has developed hundreds of scene graph models and utilized s
 cene graphs to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple core tasks
 \, including object localization\, captioning\, image generation\, questio
 n answering\, 3D understanding\, and spatio-temporal action recognition.\n
 \nSecond\, I will introduce a framework for socially situated learning. Th
 is framework pushes agents beyond traditional computer vision training par
 adigms and enables learning from human interactions in online social envir
 onments. I will showcase a real-world deployment of our agent\, which lear

 inating bugs in real systems\n\nHost: Holly Rushmeier\n\nAbstract:\n\nSoft
 ware is everywhere\, and almost everywhere\, software is broken. Some bugs
  just crash your printer\; others hand an identity thief your bank account
  number\; still others let nation-states spy on dissidents and persecute m
 inorities.\n\nThis talk outlines my work preventing bugs using a blend of 
 programming languages techniques and systems design. First\, I’ll talk a
 bout securing massive\, security-critical codebases without clean slate re
 writes. This means rooting out hard-to-find bugs—as in Sys\, which scale
 s symbolic execution to find exploitable bugs in systems like the twenty-m
 illion line Chrome browser. It also means proving correctness of especiall
 y vulnerable pieces of code—as in VeRA\, which automatically verifies pa
 rt of the Firefox JavaScript engine. Finally\, I’ll discuss work on stro
 nger foundations for new systems—as in CirC\, a recent project unifying 
 compiler infrastructure for program verification\, cryptographic proofs\, 
 optimization problems\, and more.\n\nBio:\n\nFraser Brown is a PhD student
  at Stanford advised by Dawson Engler\, occasional visiting student at UCS
 D with Deian Stefan\, and NSF graduate research fellowship recipient. She 
 works at the intersection of programming languages\, systems\, and securit
 y\, and her research has been used by several companies. She holds an unde
 rgraduate degree in English from Stanford.\n\n*Contact\nAlicia\nor\nNancy\

  Learning through Interaction in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems\n\nHost: 
 Marynel Vázquez\n\nAbstract:\n\nEffective communication is an important s
 kill for enabling information exchange and cooperation in multi-agent syst
 ems\, in which agents coexist in shared environments with humans and/or ot
 her artificial agents.  Indeed\, human domain experts can be a highly inf
 ormative source of instructive guidance and feedback (supervision).  My p
 rior work explores this type of interaction in depth\, as a mechanism for 
 enabling learning for artificial agents.  However\, dependence upon human
  partners for acquiring or adapting skills has important limitations.  Hu
 man time and cognitive load is typically constrained (particularly in real
 istic settings) and data collection from humans\, though potentially quali
 tatively rich\, can be slow and costly to acquire. Yet\, the ability to le
 arn through interaction with other agents represents another powerful mech
 anism for enabling interactive learning.  Though other artificial agents 
 may\nalso\nbe novices\, agents can co-learn through providing each other e
 valuative feedback (reinforcement)\, given the learning task has been suff
 iciently structured and allows for generalization to novel settings.\n\nTh
 is talk presents research that investigates methods for enabling agents to
  learn\ngeneral\ncommunication skills through interactions with\nother age
 nts\n.  In particular\, the talk will focus on my ongoing work within Mul
 ti-Agent Reinforcement Learning\, investigating\nemergent\ncommunication p
 rotocols\, inspired by communication in real-world problem settings.  We 
 present a novel problem setting and a general approach that allows for zer
 o-shot coordination (ZSC)\, i.e.\, discovering protocols that can generali
 ze to independently trained agents.  We also explore and analyze specific
  difficulties associated with finding globally optimal ZSC protocols\, as 
 complexity of the communication task increases or the modality for communi
 cation changes (\ne.g.\nto implicit communication through physical movemen
 t\, by a simulated robotic agent).  Overall\, this work opens up exciting
  avenues for learning\ngeneral\ncommunication protocols in complex domains
 .\n\nBio:\n\nKalesha Bullard is a postdoctoral researcher at Facebook AI R
 esearch.  She completed her PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Institute 
 of Technology in 2019\, where her research focused within the space of int
 eractive robot learning.  During her postdoc\, Kalesha has expanded her r
 esearch to explore the space of multi-agent reinforcement learning\, curre
 ntly investigating how to enable embodied multi-agent populations to learn
 \ngeneral\ncommunication protocols.  More broadly\, Kalesha’s research 
 interests span autonomous reasoning and decision making for artificial age
 nts in multi-agent settings.  To date\, her research has focused on princ
 ipled methods for enabling agents to learn through interaction with other 
 agents (human or artificial) to achieve shared goals. Beyond research\, Ka
 lesha has participated in a number of service roles throughout her researc
 h career\, recently serving on organizing and program committees for works
 hops associated with several top Artificial Intelligence conference venues
  (NeurIPS\, AAAI\, AAMAS).  This past year\, she was selected as one of t
 he 2020 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Rising Stars.\n
