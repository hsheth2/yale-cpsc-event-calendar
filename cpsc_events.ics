DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nVikram V. Ramaswamy\n\nHost: Holl
 y Rushmeier\n\nTitle: Measuring machine learning models for fairness\n\nAb
 stract:\n\nCurrent machine learning models are now incredibly powerful and
  can be used for tasks that make important decisions about people. In this
  lecture\, we’ll discuss three different metrics to evaluate these model
 s for fairness: demographic parity\, equalized odds and parity of predicti
 ve values\, and show that they are very often incompatible with each other
 . We’ll reason about what normative standards each of these metrics set\
 , and finally\, see how they interact with the larger space of machine lea
 rning fairness.\n\nBio:\n\nVikram V. Ramaswamy is a PhD candidate at Princ
 eton University\, working with Olga Russakovsky. He is interested in fairn
 ess and interpretability in machine learning\, and how it applies to visua
 l systems. In addition to his research and teaching\, he is passionate abo
 ut increasing diversity in higher education and has participated in numero
 us programs for the same\, including the Princeton Freshman Scholars Initi
 ative\, a program for first gen / low-income students\, and Princeton AI4A
 ll\, a program for high school students aimed at increasing diversity in A
 I.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-vikram-v-ramaswamy

SUMMARY:CS Talk - Sebastian Caldas
DTSTART:20230209T153000
DTEND:20230209T163000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nSebastian Caldas\n\nHost: Holly R
 ushmeier\n\nTitle\n:\nIntroduction to Linear Regression\n\nAbstract\n:\n\n
 In this lecture\, we will introduce linear regression: motivating its use 
 and covering a variety of techniques to learn its optimal parameters from 
 training data. The focus will be on developing the intuitions behind the d
 ifferent optimization algorithms\, and their advantages and disadvantages.
  We will end the lecture by briefly discussing the general trend of optimi
 zation in machine learning.\n\nBio:\n\nSebastian Caldas is a Ph.D. candida
 te in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University\, wher
 e he is advised by Artur Dubrawski. His research focuses on building intel
 ligent systems that are collaborative\, useful and practical. Currently\, 
 he is focused on federated scenarios\, particularly healthcare domains.\n\

 \n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite extraordinary progress\, current machine learning
  systems have been shown to be brittle against adversarial examples: seemi
 ngly innocuous but carefully crafted perturbations of test examples that c
 ause machine learning predictors to misclassify. Can we learn predictors r
 obust to adversarial examples? and how? There has been much empirical inte
 rest in this major challenge in machine learning\, and in this talk\, we w
 ill present a theoretical perspective. We will illustrate the need to go b
 eyond traditional approaches and principles\, such as empirical (robust) r
 isk minimization\, and present new algorithmic ideas with stronger robust 
 learning guarantees.\n\nBio:\n\nOmar Montasser is a PhD candidate at TTI-C
 hicago advised by Nathan Srebro. His research broadly explores the theory 
 and foundations of machine learning. Recently\, his research has focused o
 n understanding and characterizing adversarially robust learning\, and on 
 designing learning algorithms with provable robustness guarantees under di
 fferent settings. His work has been recognized by a best student paper awa
 rd at COLT (2019).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-omar-montasser
