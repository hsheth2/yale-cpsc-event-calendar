 s\n\nEstimating and characterizing noise in quantum devices is essential f
 or progress toward a fault-tolerant quantum computer. However\, most appro
 aches to estimating noise only work on a few qubits at a time owing to the
  difficulty of the solving a many-body problem. In this talk\, I will desc
 ribe ACES\, a method for scalable noise metrology of quantum circuits that
  stands for Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling. It simultaneously estima
 tes the individual error rates of all the gates in collections of quantum 
 circuits\, and can even account for space and time correlations between th
 ese gates. ACES strictly generalizes the commonly used methods of randomiz
 ed benchmarking (RB)\, interleaved RB\, simultaneous RB\, and several othe
 r related techniques. However\, ACES provides much more information and pr
 ovably works under strictly weaker assumptions than these techniques. Fina
 lly\, ACES is extremely scalable: we demonstrate with numerical simulation
 s that it simultaneously and precisely estimates all the Pauli error rates
  on every gate and measurement in a 100 qubit quantum device using fewer t
 han 20 relatively shallow Clifford circuits and an experimentally feasible
  number of samples. By learning the detailed gate errors for large quantum
  devices\, ACES opens new possibilities for error mitigation\, bespoke qua
 ntum error correcting codes and decoders\, customized compilers\, and more
