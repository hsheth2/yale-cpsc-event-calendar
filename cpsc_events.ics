 Abstract:\n\nAcross digital media\, Black people are portrayed in ways tha
 t are derogatory\, inaccurate\, stereotypical\, demeaning\, and otherwise 
 harmful–if we are depicted at all. The representation of afro-textured h
 air is noticeably limited\, with options ranging from comically large afro
 s\, unstyled “dread” locs\, and misshapen cornrows. In real life\, nat
 ural Black hair is considered a liability in academic and professional set
 tings\, with Black people being subject to loss of employment\, school sus
 pension\, and even having our hair forcibly removed before being allowed i
 n athletic competitions. Laws such as the Crown Act in California are maki
 ng headway toward justice and dignity for the corporeal Black body\, but w
 hat of the virtual world? What advances can we make to address issues of p
 ower and representation in digital realms?\n\nIn this talk\, artist and de
 signer A.M. Darke discussing her development of the Open Source Afro Hair 
 Library\, a queer\, feminist\, antiracist 3D database for Black hair textu
 res and styles. Functioning both as art practice and technological develop
 ment\, OSAHL is an interventionist work\, building the resources needed to
  fundamentally reimagine the construction and consumption of Black bodies 
 in virtual space.\n\nBio:\n\nA.M. Darke is an artist and game maker design
 ing radical tools for social intervention. Still in the class war. Now in 
 the pandemic. He’s in the combination class war and pandemic. Assistant 
 Professor of Performance\, Play & Design\, Digital Arts and New Media\, an
 d Critical Race and Ethnic Studies\, at UC Santa Cruz\, Darke also directs
  The Other Lab\, an interdisciplinary\, intersectional feminist research s
 pace for experimental games and new media. Darke’s recent work includes 
 ‘Ye or Nay?\, a Kanye West-themed game about Black culture\, and the Ope
 n Source Afro Hair Library\, a 3D model database for Black hair styles and
  textures. Darke holds a B.A. in Design (’13) and an M.F.A. in Media Art
 s (’15)\, both from UCLA. He has completed residencies with Laboratory\,
  NYU Game Center\, the Open Data Institute\, and the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO 
 for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon. Additionally\, his work has been 
 shown internationally and featured in a variety of publications\, includin
 g Kill Screen\, Vice\, and NPR.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloq

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nBo Hu\n\nTitle: Sys
 tem Abstractions for Scaling Application Development at the Edge\n\nAdviso

 ictor Bahl (Microsoft Research)\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecent years have witness
 ed an explosive growth of Internet of things (IoT) devices\, which collect
  or generate huge amounts of data. Given diverse device capabilities and a
 pplication requirements\, data processing takes place across a range of se
 ttings\, from on-device to a nearby edge server/cloud and remote cloud. Co
 nsequently\, edge-cloud coordination has been studied extensively from the
  perspectives of job placement\, scheduling and joint optimization. Typica
 l approaches focus on performance optimization for individual applications
 . This often requires domain knowledge of the applications\, but also lead
 s to application-specific solutions. Application development and deploymen
 t over diverse scenarios thus incur repetitive manual efforts.\n\nThere ar
 e two overarching challenges to provide system-level support for applicati
 on development at the edge. First\, there is inherent heterogeneity at the
  device hardware level. The execution settings may range from a small clus
 ter as an edge cloud to on-device inference on embedded devices\, differin
 g in hardware capability and programming environments. Further\, applicati
 on performance requirements vary significantly\, making it even more diffi
 cult to map different applications to already heterogeneous hardware. Sec
 ond\, there are trends towards incorporating edge and cloud and multi-moda
 l data. Together\, these add further dimensions to the design space and i
 ncrease the complexity significantly.\n\nIn this thesis\, we propose a nov
 el framework to simplify application development and deployment over a con
 tinuum of edge to cloud. Our framework provides key connections between di
 fferent dimensions of design considerations\, corresponding to the applica
 tion abstraction\, data abstraction and resource management abstraction re
 spectively.\n\nFirst\, our framework masks hardware heterogeneity with abs
 tract resource types through containerization\, and abstracts away the app
 lication processing pipelines into generic flow graphs. Further\, our fram
 ework further supports a notion of degradable computing for application sc
 enarios at the edge that are involved with multimodal sensory input. Next\
 , we include a generic data management service between video query systems
  and a video store to organize video data at the edge. We propose a video 
 data unit abstraction based on a notion of distance between objects in the
  video\, quantifying the semantic similarity among video data. Last\, cons
 idering concurrent application execution\, our framework supports multi-ap
 plication offloading with device-centric control\, with a system-level sch
 eduler service that wraps over the operating system scheduler.\n\n\nhttps:
