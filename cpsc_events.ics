DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAlex Aiken\, Stanford Unive
 rsity\n\nHost: Ruzica Piskac\n\nTitle: Legion: Programming Heterogeneous\,
  Distributed Parallel Machines\n\nAbstract:\n\nProgrammers tend to think o
 f parallel programming as a problem of dividing up computation\, but often
  the most difficult part is the placement and movement of data.  As machi
 nes become more complex and hierarchical\, describing what to do with the 
 data is increasingly a first-class programming concern.  Legion is a prog
 ramming model and runtime system for describing hierarchical organizations
  of both data and computation at an abstract level. A separate mapping int
 erface allows programmers to control how data and computation are placed o
 nto the actual memories and processors of a specific machine.  This talk 
 will present the design of Legion\, the novel issues that arise in both th
 e design and implementation\, and experience with applications.\n\nBio:\n\
 nAlex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor of Computer Science at Stanfor
 d. Alex received his Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Music from B
 owling Green State University in 1983 and his Ph.D. from Cornell Universit
 y in 1988. Alex was a Research Staff Member at the IBM Almaden Research Ce
 nter (1988-1993) and a Professor in the EECS department at UC Berkeley (19
 93-2003) before joining the Stanford faculty in 2003. His research interes
 t is in areas related to programming languages. He is an ACM Fellow\, a re
 cipient of ACM SIGPLAN’s Programming Languages Achievement Award and Phi
  Beta Kappa’s Teaching Award\, and a former chair of the Stanford Comput
 er Science Department.\n

SUMMARY:CS Talk - Akshitha Sriraman

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk - Akshitha Sriraman\n\nHost: Abhis
 hek Bhattacharjee\n\nTitle: Enabling Hyperscale Web Services\n\nAbstract:
 \n\nModern hyperscale web service systems introduce trade-offs between per
 formance and numerous features essential for cost- and energy-efficient op
 eration of data centers (e.g.\, high server utilization\, continuous power
  management\, use of commodity hardware and software\, etc.). In this talk
 \, I will present two solutions to bridge the performance vs. cost and ene
 rgy efficiency gap in hyperscale web services (1) a software system that a
 uto-tunes threading models during system run-time to minimize web service 
 tail latency (OSDI 2018) and (2) a system that exploits coarse-grained OS 
 and hardware configuration knobs to tune limited cost-efficient commodity 
 hardware stock keeping units\, to better support their assigned service (I
 SCA 2019).\n\nBio\n:\n\n\nAkshitha Sriraman is a Ph.D. candidate at the Un
 iversity of Michigan. She is advised by Prof. Thomas F. Wenisch on her com
 puter architecture and systems dissertation research\, specifically on the
  topic of enabling hyperscale web services. Her work bridges computer arch
 itecture and software systems and demonstrates the importance of that brid
 ge in improving the performance\, cost\, and energy efficiency of modern h
 yperscale data center systems. Sriraman has influenced the design of serve
 r architectures both via hardware analysis of production data center syste
 ms and her subsequent software design that uses data center hardware more 
 efficiently\; she received recognition for this work via the 2020 Facebook
  Distributed Systems Fellowship. Additionally\, Sriraman has developed a n
 ovel software system that improves data center performance by minimizing t
 ail latency\; she was awarded the Rakham Merit Ph.D. Fellowship to help fu
 nd this work.\n
