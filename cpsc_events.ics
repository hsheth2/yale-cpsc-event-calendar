DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nComputation and Society Colloquium\n\nSpea
 ker:\nAaron Roth\n\, Univ. of Pennsylvania\nTitle: The Ethical Algorithm\n
 Host:\nElisa Celis\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\n\nIn recent years\, there has been 
 an explosion of reports of automated systems exhibiting undesirable behavi
 or — often manifesting itself in terms of gross violations of social nor
 ms like privacy and fairness. This poses new challenges for regulation and
  governance\, in part because these bad algorithmic behaviors are not the 
 result of mal-intent on the part of their designers\, but are instead the 
 unanticipated side effects of applying the standard tools of machine learn
 ing. The solution must therefore be in part algorithmic — we need to dev
 elop a scientific approach aiming to formalize the kinds of behaviors we w
 ant to avoid\, and design algorithms that avoid them. We will survey this 
 area\, focusing in both the more mature area of private algorithm design\,
  as well as the more nascent area of algorithmic fairness. We will touch o
 n other issues\, including how we can think about the larger societal effe
 cts of imposing constraints on specific algorithmic parts of larger sociot
 echnical systems.\n\n\n\nThis talk is based on the book\n“The Ethical Al
 gorithm”\n\, which is jointly authored with Michael Kearns\, and is avai
 lable now\, from Oxford University Press.\n\n\n\nhttps://computationsociet

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe dates for the Joint Boards of Permanen
 t Officers (JBPO) have been scheduled for the 2020-21 academic year.  Ple
 ase reserve:\n\nThursday\, October 8\, 2020\n\nThursday\, October 29\, 202

 rsday\, April 15\, 2021\n\nThursday\, May 13\, 2021\n\nAll meetings start 
 at 4:00 p.m. and will be via Zoom for the foreseeable future. Two weeks pr
 ior to each meeting\, an email will be sent with the link to preregister f
 or the meeting\, along with the CONFIDENTIAL agenda and supporting materia
 ls. After preregistering you will receive a confirmation email containing 
 the Zoom link to join the meeting.\n\nIn order to ensure a quorum*\, pleas
 e attend if you are able\, especially if you are a designated quorum offic
 er of your department or program.\n\n*Voting in the Joint Boards of Perman
 ent Officers. Full professors whose primary or fully joint appointments ar
 e in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department may vote\, as may full prof
 essors of professional schools with secondary appointments in a Faculty of
  Arts and Sciences department and explicit Corporation approval for such v
 oting rights. The only exception to this rule is for faculty in Molecular 
 Biophysics and Biochemistry who are assigned to vote in the School of Medi
 cine’s Board of Permanent Officers and may not also vote in the Joint Bo
 ards of Permanent Officers of Yale College and the Graduate School. By lon
 g standing custom\, a quorum for the conduct of business at a meeting of t
 he Joint Boards consists of 37 members eligible to vote. No vote has force
  if the number of votes\, plus recorded abstentions\, falls short of that 
 number. Tenure appointments are forwarded to the Corporation only upon an 
 affirmative vote by two-thirds of the members present and eligible to vote
 . All other appointments are approved by majority vote. (Faculty Handbook\
