 raphical Models: From Missing Data to the Future of Artificial Intelligenc
 e\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe remarkable progress in AI and machine learning owe m
 uch to the availability of massive amounts of data\, and where there is da
 ta\, there is missingness. The rich tend to conceal their income\, smokers
  hide their habit\, and patients drop out from clinical trials.\n\nThe bul
 k of literature on missing data employs data-centric routines as opposed t
 o process-centric methodology and relies on assumptions that are both opaq
 ue and untestable and (e.g.: Missing At Random (MAR)\, Rubin 1976). As a r
 esult\, this area of research is wanting in tools to encode knowledge abou
 t the underlying data generating process\, methods to test this knowledge 
 and procedures to decide if and how quantities of interest are estimable f
 rom the available data.\n\nI address these deficiencies by using a graphic
 al representation called “Missingness Graph” which portrays the causal
  mechanisms responsible for missingness. Using this representation\, I def
 ine the notion of recoverability\, i.e.\, deciding whether there exists a 
 consistent estimator for a given quantity of interest such as joint distri
 butions\, conditional distributions and causal effects. The resultant meth
 ods apply to all types of missing data including the notorious and relativ
 ely unexplored NMAR (Not Missing At Random) category. I further address th
 e question of testability i.e.  if and how an assumed model can be subjec
 ted to statistical tests\, considering the missingness in the data.\n\nVie
 wing the missing data problem from a causal perspective has ushered in sev
 eral notable surprises. These include recoverability when variables are ca
 uses of their own missingness\, testability of MAR models\, alternatives t
 o iterative procedures such as Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and
  the indispensability of causal assumptions for handling missing data prob
 lems.\n\nBuilding on the power and ubiquity of graphical causal models\, m
 y agenda for the coming years is to explore other problem areas that have 
 impeded progress in AI and machine learning. These include algorithms to b
 ridge the gap between recoverability and estimation\, causal discovery alg
 orithms\, robust solutions for problems in AI Ethics such as fairness and 
 privacy and working towards developing human-level AI. I am particularly i
 ntrigued by the prospects of using intervention and counterfactual logic t
 o formulate and solve these problems. I will outline some of these wide-op
 en frontiers in my talk.\n\nBio:\n\nKarthika Mohan is a postdoctoral schol
 ar at the computer science department in University of California\, Berkel
 ey. Karthika received her PhD in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence
 ) from University of California\, Los Angeles (UCLA) where she was advised
  by Judea Pearl. Her research is of an interdisciplinary nature and her ar
 eas of interest include Causal Inference\, Graphical Models and AI Safety.
  She was awarded the Google Outstanding Graduate Research Award\, 2017 whi
 ch is a UCLA Commencement Award. Currently she serves on the editorial boa
 rd of the Journal of Causal Inference.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Cheng Tan
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200213T210000

 g\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: How to Audit Outsourced Services\n
 \nAbstract:\n\nHow can users of a cloud service verify that the service tr
 uly performs as promised? This question is vital today because clouds are 
 complicated black boxes\, running in different administrative domains from
  users. Their correctness can be undermined by internal corruptions—misc
 onfigurations\, operational mistakes\, insider attacks\, unexpected failur
 es\, or adversarial control at any layer of the execution stack. This talk
  will present verifiable infrastructure\, a framework that lets users audi
 t outsourced applications and services. I will introduce two systems: Oroc
 hi and Cobra\, which verify the execution of\, respectively\, untrusted se
 rvers and black-box databases. Orochi and Cobra introduce various techniqu
 es\, including deduplicated re-execution\, consistent ordering verificatio
 n\, GPU accelerated pruning\, and others. Beyond these two systems\, I wil
 l also discuss verifiable infrastructure more generally.\n\nBio:\n\nCheng 
 Tan is a computer science Ph.D. candidate in the Courant Institute at New 
 York University. His interests are in operating systems\, networked system
 s\, and security. His work on the Efficient Server Audit Problem was award
 ed best paper at SOSP 2017. His work on data center network troubleshootin
 g at Microsoft Research has been deployed globally in more than 30 data ce
 nters in Microsoft Azure.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-c

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni
 versity and bachelor’s degrees in computer science and in economics from
  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the
  University of Washington as a postdoc. His research interests include hum
 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc
 ience. His work has been covered by many news media outlets\, such as the 
 New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won an NSF CRII award\, a 
 Salesforce research award\, a Facebook fellowship\, and a Yahoo! Key Scien
 tific Challenges award.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-che
