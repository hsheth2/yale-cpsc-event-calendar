 n\nTitle: Algorithmic Advances for the Design and Analysis of Randomized 
 Experiments\n\nAdvisors: Daniel Spielman and Amin Karbasi\n\nOther commit
 tee members:\nSekhar Tatikonda\nFredrik Sävje\n\nAbstract:\n\nRandomized 
 experiments are the gold standard for establishing the causal effect of a 
 treatment on a population. In this dissertation\, I present algorithmic ad
 vances for three different problems arising in the design and analysis of 
 randomized experiments: covariate balancing\, variance estimation\, and bi
 partite experiments.\n\nIn the first part of the defense\, we describe an 
 inherent trade-off between covariate balancing and robustness\, which is t
 hen formulated as a distributional discrepancy problem. In order to navig
 ate this trade-off\, we present the Gram–Schmidt Walk Design which is ba
 sed on the recent discrepancy algorithm of Bansal\, Dadush\, Garg\, and Lo
 vett (2019). By tightening the algorithmic analysis\, we derive bounds on 
 the mean squared error of the Horvitz–Thompson estimator under this desi
 gn in terms of a ridge regression of the outcomes on the covariates\, whic
 h we interpret as regression by design. We carry out further analysis incl
 uding tail bounds on the effect estimator\, methods for constructing confi
 dence intervals\, and a kernel method extension of the design which accomm
 odates non-linear responses.\n\nIn the second part of the dense\, we study
  the problem of estimating the variance of treatment effect estimators und
 er interference. It is well-known that due to the fundamental problem of c
 ausal inference\, unbiased variance estimation is impossible without stron
 g assumption on the outcomes. Thus\, we study a class of conservative esti
 mators which are based on variance bounds. We identify conditions under wh
 ich the variance bounds themselves are admissible and provide a general al
 gorithmic framework to construct admissible variance bounds\, according to
  the experimenter’s preferences and prior substantive knowledge.\n\nTime
  permitting\, we will present methodology for the newly proposed bipartite
  experimental framework\, where units which receive treatment are distinct
  from units on which outcomes are measured\, and the two are connected via
  a bipartite graph. We propose the Exposure Re-weighted Linear (ERL) estim
 ator which we show is unbiased in finite samples and consistent and asympt
 otically normal in large samples provided the bipartite graph is sufficien
 tly sparse. We provide an variance estimator which facilitates confidence 
 intervals based on the normal approximation. Finally\, we present Exposure
 -Design\, a correlation clustering based design for improving precision of
  the ERL estimator.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-
