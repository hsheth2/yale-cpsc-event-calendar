DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nRasmus Kyng\, ETH Zurich\n\
 nHost: Dan Spielman\n\nAn Almost-Linear Time Algorithm for Maximum Flow an
 d More\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk\, I will explain a new algorithm for c
 omputing exact maximum and minimum-cost flows in almost-linear time\, sett
 ling the time complexity of these basic graph problems up to subpolynomial
  factors.\n\nOur algorithm uses a novel interior point method that builds 
 the optimal flow as a sequence of approximate minimum-ratio cycles\, each 
 of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynamic da
 ta structure.\n\nBy well-known reductions\, our result implies almost-line
 ar time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching\, opt
 imal transport\, and undirected vertex connectivity. Our framework also ex
 tends to minimizing general edge-separable convex functions to high accura
 cy\, yielding the first almost-linear time algorithms for many other probl
 ems including entropy-regularized optimal transport\, matrix scaling\, p-n
 orm flows\, and isotonic regression.\n\nThis talk is based on joint work w
 ith Li Chen\, Yang P. Liu\, Richard Peng\, Maximilian Probst Gutenberg\, a
 nd Sushant Sachdeva. Our result appeared in FOCS’22 and won the FOCS bes
 t paper award.\n\nBio:\n\nRasmus Kyng is an assistant professor of theoret
 ical computer science at ETH Zurich. Before joining the department in 2019
 \, he was a postdoctoral fellow and Harvard SEAS and the Simons Institute 
 at UC Berkeley. In 2017\, he received a PhD in computer science from Yale 
 University\, where he was advised by Daniel Spielman.\n\nHis work focuses 
 on fast algorithms for solving graph problems\, convex optimization\, and 
 structured linear equations. In addition\, he develops hardness results fo
 r basic algorithmic problems and probability theoretic tools for algorithm
 ic applications. His research has won the FOCS’22 best paper and FOCS’
 17 best student paper awards.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloqui
