 ems for Future Workloads\, Hardware\, and Performance Requirements\n\nAbst
 ract:\n\nThe storage stack needs to undergo radical change to keep up with
  future workloads\, hardware\, and performance requirements. First\, workl
 oads evolved from following a read-heavy pattern (e.g.\, a static web-page
 ) to a\nwrite-heavy\nprofile where the read:write ratio is closer to 1:1 (
 e.g.\, users’ actions are being recorded\,\nwhile\nthey are browsing web
 -pages). Second\, the hardware is undergoing rapid changes.  The divide b
 etween fine-grained volatile memory and slow block-level storage is rapidl
 y being bridged by the emerging byte-addressable non-volatile memory devic
 es and the fast block-addressable NVMe SSDs (e.g.\, Intel Optane NVMe SSDs
 ). Third\, performance requirements in storage systems now emphasize low t
 ail latency\, in addition to high throughput. In this talk I discuss the m
 ain storage systems challenges raised by future workloads\, hardware\, and
  performance requirements\, and present a new design paradigm for key-valu
 e stores to efficiently handle write-heavy workloads. Existing storage sys
 tems have fundamental limitations that do not allow them to fully leverage
  modern hardware. These limitations stem from the longstanding idea that s
 torage systems need to optimize storage device usage. However\, new storag
 e hardware shifts the bottleneck from I/O to CPU. Based on this key observ
 ation\, I introduce a new key-value store design which minimizes the use o
 f CPU\, to achieve good performance on block-addressable NVMe SSDs. The ov
 erarching principles that optimize CPU use are: (1) avoid maintaining the 
 data sorted on-disk\, (2) minimize contention due to shared data structure
 s\, and (3) remove expensive maintenance operations ran internally by the 
 key-value store.\n\nBio:\n\nOana Balmau is a PhD candidate in the School o
 f Computer Science at the University of Sydney\, advised by Prof. Willy Zw
 aenepoel. She earned her Bachelors and Masters degrees in Computer Science
  from EPFL\, Switzerland. Her research interests are computer systems and 
 storage technologies. Currently\, she is working towards redesigning stora
 ge systems\, aimed at future workloads and hardware. (Homepage:\noanabalma

 \nAbstract:\n\nHow can users of a cloud service verify that the service tr
 uly performs as promised? This question is vital today because clouds are 
 complicated black boxes\, running in different administrative domains from
  users. Their correctness can be undermined by internal corruptions—misc
 onfigurations\, operational mistakes\, insider attacks\, unexpected failur
 es\, or adversarial control at any layer of the execution stack. This talk
  will present verifiable infrastructure\, a framework that lets users audi
 t outsourced applications and services. I will introduce two systems: Oroc
 hi and Cobra\, which verify the execution of\, respectively\, untrusted se
 rvers and black-box databases. Orochi and Cobra introduce various techniqu
 es\, including deduplicated re-execution\, consistent ordering verificatio
 n\, GPU accelerated pruning\, and others. Beyond these two systems\, I wil
 l also discuss verifiable infrastructure more generally.\n\nBio:\n\nCheng 
 Tan is a computer science Ph.D. candidate in the Courant Institute at New 
 York University. His interests are in operating systems\, networked system
 s\, and security. His work on the Efficient Server Audit Problem was award
 ed best paper at SOSP 2017. His work on data center network troubleshootin
 g at Microsoft Research has been deployed globally in more than 30 data ce
 nters in Microsoft Azure.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-c

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni
 versity and bachelor’s degrees in computer science and in economics from
  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the
  University of Washington as a postdoc. His research interests include hum
 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc
 ience. His work has been covered by many news media outlets\, such as the 
 New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won an NSF CRII award\, a 
 Salesforce research award\, a Facebook fellowship\, and a Yahoo! Key Scien
 tific Challenges award.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-che
