SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Henry Corrigan-Gibbs\, MIT
DTSTART:20221129T210000
DTEND:20221129T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nHenry Corrigan-Gibbs\, MIT\
 n\nHost: Charalampos Papamanthou\n\nTitle: Simple and Fast Private Informa
 tion Retrieval\n\nAbstract:\n\nPrivate-information-retrieval protocols all
 ow a client to query a database server without revealing its query to the 
 server. With private information retrieval\, a client can\, for example\, 
 download an article from Wikipedia without revealing which article it fetc
 hed. Existing schemes for private information retrieval require large amou
 nts of computation – both asymptotically and concretely. Computational c
 ost is the major barrier to the use of private information retrieval in pr
 actice.\n\nThis talk will present SimplePIR\, the fastest single-server pr
 ivate-information-retrieval scheme known to date. SimplePIR improves the p
 erformance of state-of-the-art schemes by over 30x and can answer private 
 queries to a 1 GB database in under 100ms using a single CPU core. The sch
 eme is simple to describe and easy to implement\, which gives us hope that
  it will see adoption in industry. After describing the new scheme\, I wil
 l discuss how we might apply it to strengthen privacy protections in the C
 hrome web browser. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the scheme
 ’s limitations\, along with a few open problems in the area.\n\nThis tal
 k is based on joint work with Alexandra Henzinger (MIT)\, Matthew Hong (MI
 T)\, Sarah Meiklejohn (Google)\, and Vinod Vaikuntanathan (MIT).\n\nBio:\n
 \nHenry Corrigan-Gibbs (he/him) is an assistant professor at MIT in the De
 partment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Henry builds comp
 uter systems that provide strong security and privacy properties using ide
 as from cryptography\, computer security\, and computer systems. Henry com
 pleted his PhD in the Applied Cryptography Group at Stanford\, where he wa
 s advised by Dan Boneh. Henry was an undergrad at Yale\, and he ended up s
 tudying computer science by accident after shopping CPSC 201 with Dana Ang
 luin. His teachers there – including Stanley Eisenstat\, Daniel Spielman
 \, and Michael Fischer – set the standard for computer-science education
  that he someday hopes to meet. Henry got involved in research through an 
 undergrad project at Yale with Bryan Ford\, who showed him how much fun re
 search can be.\n\nFor their efforts\, Henry and his collaborators have rec
 eived an Honorable Mention for the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award\, three
  IACR Best Young Researcher Paper Awards (at Eurocrypt in 2020\, the Theor
 y of Cryptography Conference in 2019 and at Eurocrypt in 2018)\, the 2016 
 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technolo
 gies\, and the 2015 IEEE Security and Privacy Distinguished Paper Award. H
 enry’s work has influenced IETF and NIST standards\, and his Prio system
  for privacy-preserving telemetry data collection is used today in the Fir
 efox web browser\, Apple’s iOS\, and Google’s Android operating system

SUMMARY:Dissertation Defense - Ning Luo

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nNing Luo\n\nTime is 
 tentative\n\nTitle: Privacy-preserving formal methods\n\nAdvisor: Ruzica P
 iskac\n\nOther Committee Members:\n\nTimos Antonopoulos\nClark Barrett (St
 anford University)\nDan Boneh (Stanford University)\nZhong Shao\n\nAbstrac
 t:\n\nSoftware and hardware can often exhibit undesirable behaviors\, whic
 h can lead to catastrophic consequences. Formal methods offer a vast colle
 ction of techniques to analyze and verify these systems mathematically to 
 ensure the correctness\, robustness\, and safety of software and hardware 
 systems against a specification.\n\nDespite the significant success of for
 mal method techniques\, privacy requirements are not being considered in t
 heir design. On the other hand\, formal methods are often used to verify t
 he critical components of systems\, which is frequently valuable intellect
 ual property. Furthermore\, the specification requirements are often impos
 ed by outside parties in some settings\, such as regulatory agencies or so
 ftware marketplaces\, entities that are not always trusted by the system o
 wners.\n\nMy study of designing efficient formal methods that retain a pro
 gram’s privacy is guided by these proprietary concerns. In this disserta
 tion\, I introduce a suite of privacy-preserving formal method techniques 
 I have designed:\n\n\nPrivacy-preserving SAT solving. The SAT problem is f
 inding an assignment of variables to make a Boolean formula evaluate to tr
 ue. As one of the most fundamental problems\, it is the core of many verif
 ication techniques with SMT solvers often being crucial components. This d
 issertation describes ppSAT: a privacy-preserving SAT solver that enables 
 two parties to decide whether the conjunction of their secret formulae is 
 satisfiable or not while maintaining the privacy of each party’s input f
 ormulae.\n\nRefutation proofs in zero knowledge.  Proving that a given Bo
 olean formula is unsatisfiable is critical in formal methods for illustrat
 ing the safety or robustness of a system\, and the existing state-of-the-a
 rt techniques utilize resolution proofs. This dissertation presents a zero
 -knowledge protocol for proving the unsatisfiability of Boolean formulae i
 n propositional logic. We encode the verification of a resolution proof us
 ing polynomial equivalence checking\, which enabled us to use a fast ZK pr
 otocol for verifying relations between polynomials.\n\nPrivacy-preserving 
 model checking for CTL formulae. Model checking is the problem of verifyin
 g whether an abstract model of a computational system meets a specificatio
 n of behavior given as a logic formula. This dissertation explains how to 
 apply secure multiparty computation (MPC) to model-checking algorithms to 
 maintain the privacy of both the model and the specification. Our approach
  adopts oblivious graph algorithms to allow for secure computation of glob
 al explicit state model checking with specifications written in Computatio
 n Tree Logic (CTL).\n\nPrivate regular expression pattern matching based o
 n NFA. Regular expression pattern matching is one of the fundamental query
  operations in computer science and formal languages. Many applications\, 
 such as network intrusion detection and policy checking for DNS queries\, 
 depend on such queries which are also increasingly concerned with privacy 
 issues. This dissertation demonstrates a private regular expression patter
 n-matching design based on the oblivious stack and transfer protocols. The
  former results in the best-known asymptotic complexity for regular expres
 sion pattern matching\, while the latter leads to optimal numerical perfor
 mance.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-ning-luo
