DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nRichard L. Sites\n\nHost: M
 ichael Fischer\n\nTitle: Making the Invisible Visible\nObserving Complex S
 oftware Dynamics\n\nAbstract\n\nFrom mobile and cloud apps to video games 
 to driverless vehicle control\, more and more software is time-constrained
 : it must deliver reliable results seamlessly\, consistently\, and virtual
 ly instantaneously. If it doesn’t\, customers are unhappy–and sometime
 s lives are put at risk. When complex software underperforms or fails\, id
 entifying the root causes is difficult and\, historically\, few tools have
  been available to help\, leaving application developers to guess what mig
 ht be happening. How can we do better?\n\nThe key is to have low-overhead 
 observation tools that can show exactly where all the  elapsed time goes 
 in both normal responses and in delayed responses. Doing so makes visible 
 each of the seven possible reasons for such delays\, as we show.\n\nBio\n\
 nRichard L. Sites wrote his first computer program in 1959 and has spent m
 ost of his career at the boundary between hardware and software\, with a p
 articular interest in CPU/software performance interactions. His past work
  includes VAX microcode\, DEC Alpha co-architect\, and inventing the perfo
 rmance counters found in nearly all processors today. He has done low-over
 head microcode and software tracing at DEC\, Adobe\, Google\, and Tesla. D
 r. Sites earned his PhD at Stanford in 1974\; he holds 66 patents and is a
  member of the US National Academy of Engineering.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.
