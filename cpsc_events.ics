 raphical Models: From Missing Data to the Future of Artificial Intelligenc
 e\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe remarkable progress in AI and machine learning owe m
 uch to the availability of massive amounts of data\, and where there is da
 ta\, there is missingness. The rich tend to conceal their income\, smokers
  hide their habit\, and patients drop out from clinical trials.\n\nThe bul
 k of literature on missing data employs data-centric routines as opposed t
 o process-centric methodology and relies on assumptions that are both opaq
 ue and untestable and (e.g.: Missing At Random (MAR)\, Rubin 1976). As a r
 esult\, this area of research is wanting in tools to encode knowledge abou
 t the underlying data generating process\, methods to test this knowledge 
 and procedures to decide if and how quantities of interest are estimable f
 rom the available data.\n\nI address these deficiencies by using a graphic
 al representation called “Missingness Graph” which portrays the causal
  mechanisms responsible for missingness. Using this representation\, I def
 ine the notion of recoverability\, i.e.\, deciding whether there exists a 
 consistent estimator for a given quantity of interest such as joint distri
 butions\, conditional distributions and causal effects. The resultant meth
 ods apply to all types of missing data including the notorious and relativ
 ely unexplored NMAR (Not Missing At Random) category. I further address th
 e question of testability i.e.  if and how an assumed model can be subjec
 ted to statistical tests\, considering the missingness in the data.\n\nVie
 wing the missing data problem from a causal perspective has ushered in sev
 eral notable surprises. These include recoverability when variables are ca
 uses of their own missingness\, testability of MAR models\, alternatives t
 o iterative procedures such as Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and
  the indispensability of causal assumptions for handling missing data prob
 lems.\n\nBuilding on the power and ubiquity of graphical causal models\, m
 y agenda for the coming years is to explore other problem areas that have 
 impeded progress in AI and machine learning. These include algorithms to b
 ridge the gap between recoverability and estimation\, causal discovery alg
 orithms\, robust solutions for problems in AI Ethics such as fairness and 
 privacy and working towards developing human-level AI. I am particularly i
 ntrigued by the prospects of using intervention and counterfactual logic t
 o formulate and solve these problems. I will outline some of these wide-op
 en frontiers in my talk.\n\nBio:\n\nKarthika Mohan is a postdoctoral schol
 ar at the computer science department in University of California\, Berkel
 ey. Karthika received her PhD in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence
 ) from University of California\, Los Angeles (UCLA) where she was advised
  by Judea Pearl. Her research is of an interdisciplinary nature and her ar
 eas of interest include Causal Inference\, Graphical Models and AI Safety.

 \nAbstract:\n\nHow can users of a cloud service verify that the service tr
 uly performs as promised? This question is vital today because clouds are 
 complicated black boxes\, running in different administrative domains from
  users. Their correctness can be undermined by internal corruptions—misc
 onfigurations\, operational mistakes\, insider attacks\, unexpected failur
 es\, or adversarial control at any layer of the execution stack. This talk
  will present verifiable infrastructure\, a framework that lets users audi
 t outsourced applications and services. I will introduce two systems: Oroc
 hi and Cobra\, which verify the execution of\, respectively\, untrusted se
 rvers and black-box databases. Orochi and Cobra introduce various techniqu
 es\, including deduplicated re-execution\, consistent ordering verificatio
 n\, GPU accelerated pruning\, and others. Beyond these two systems\, I wil
 l also discuss verifiable infrastructure more generally.\n\nBio:\n\nCheng 
 Tan is a computer science Ph.D. candidate in the Courant Institute at New 
 York University. His interests are in operating systems\, networked system

 age Processing Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nWhile modern NLP systems have achie
 ved outstanding performance on static benchmarks\, they often fail catastr
 ophically when presented with inputs from different sources or inputs that
  have been adversarial perturbed. This lack of robustness exposes troublin
 g gaps in current models’ understanding capabilities\, and poses challen
 ges for deployment of NLP systems in high-stakes situations. In this talk\
 , I will demonstrate that building robust NLP systems requires reexamining
  all aspects of the current model building paradigm. First\, I will show t
 hat adversarially constructed test data reveals vulnerabilities that are l
 eft unexposed by standard evaluation methods. Second\, I will demonstrate 
 that active learning\, in which data is adaptively collected based on a mo
 del’s current predictions\, can significantly improve the ability of mod
 els to generalize robustly\, compared to the use of static training datase
 ts. Finally\, I will show how to train NLP models to produce certificates 
 of robustness—guarantees that for a given example and combinatorially la
 rge class of possible perturbations\, no perturbation can cause a misclass
 ification.\n\nBio:\n\nRobin Jia is a sixth-year Ph.D. student at Stanford 
 University advised by Percy Liang. His research interests lie broadly in b
 uilding natural language processing systems that can generalize to unexpec
 ted test-time inputs. Robin’s work has received an Outstanding Paper Awa

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAayush Bansal\n\nHost: Mary
 nel Vazquez\n\nCoffee available at 10:15\n\nTitle: Data-driven Computation
 al Studio\n\nAbstract:\n\nHuman life is composed of moments and experience
 s. Imagine going back in time and revisiting crucial moments of your life\
 , such as your wedding ceremony\, or the first birthday of your child\, as
  if you are present at the moment\; Or picture Abraham Lincoln delivering 
 the Gettysburg Address and telling you the story of the American Civil War
 . These phenomena are currently limited to human imagination alone. A comp
 utational machinery that can understand and create a four-dimensional audi
 o-visual world can enable humans to realize their vision and share it with
  others. In this talk\, I will introduce my research on the Computational 
 Studio that allows average humans to relive old memories like a virtual ti
 me travel\, automatically create new experiences\, and express themselves 
 using everyday computational devices audio-visually. In the first part of 
 the talk\, I will describe my work on capturing and browsing 4D audio-visu
 al world and efforts on building a multi-robot capture system. The applica
 tions of this work transcend virtualized reality to digitize intangible cu
 ltural heritage\, capture tribal dances and wildlife in natural environmen
 t\, and understand the social behavior of human beings. I will then presen
 t my research on synthesizing the audio-visual world in an unsupervised ma
 nner. Finally\, I will demonstrate the importance of thinking about a huma
 n user and computational devices when designing content creation applicati
 ons.\n\nBio:\n\nAayush Bansal is a Ph.D. candidate at the Robotics Institu

 bhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: Scalable Synch
 ronization Mechanisms for Many-core Operating Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith
  the increasing demand for big data processing\, we have seen tremendous g
 rowth in the adoption and commoditization of many-core machines that span 
 beyond hundreds of hardware threads over the past decade. Even cloud provi
 ders are offering such large machines to allow users to process data as qu
 ickly as possible. To efficiently utilize such resources\, developers rely
  on various synchronization mechanisms as essential building blocks for de
 signing high-performance many-core applications.\n\nIn this talk\, I will 
 focus on designing new synchronization mechanisms for highly concurrent so
 ftware: the operating system. First\, I will show that existing locking pr
 imitives are a big deterrent to the scalability of the operating system. T
 hen\, I will present a new methodology to build scalable and practical loc
 king algorithms that break the decade-old convention of coupling lock’s 
 hardware/software policies and implementation. The family of locks I propo
 se\, not only have the least memory footprint but also the highest through
 put for any thread count. Second\, I will present another scalability prob
 lem that occurs in existing timestamp-based algorithms\, such as concurren
 cy control mechanisms and concurrent data structure frameworks. I will add
 ress this issue with a scalable timestamping primitive by providing an ill
 usion of a global clock\, thereby making such algorithms many-core friendl
 y. Finally\, I will end the talk with my vision for building evolving serv
 ices for operating systems to incorporate the fast-changing hardware as we
 ll as software.\n\nBio:\n\nSanidhya Kashyap is a Ph.D. candidate in the Sc
 hool of Computer Science at Georgia Tech\, advised by Taesoo Kim at Georgi
 a Tech and Changwoo Min at Virginia Tech. His research interests are broad
 ly in the area of systems with a focus on designing scalable and robust sy
 stems software. His thesis focuses on revisiting the design of synchroniza
 tion primitives and their impact across software stack. His works have won
  two best paper awards and found more than 250 bugs in the Linux file syst
 ems.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-sanidhya-kashyap

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni

  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the

 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc
 ience. His work has been covered by many news media outlets\, such as the 
 New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won an NSF CRII award\, a

  Diagnosis for Distributed Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed software sy
 stems have become the backbone of Internet services. Consequently\, Failur
 es in production distributed systems have severe consequences. A 63-minute
  outage of Amazon in 2018 caused a 100-million loss in revenue. Moreover\,
  the frequency of failures rises with the increasing complexity of softwar
 e systems. 2019 has experienced noticeably more Internet outages and is so
 metimes considered as the “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failur
 es in distributed systems at data center scale is a particularly critical\
 , yet notoriously difficult task because these systems are complex: there 
 are numerous threads\, processes\, and nodes communicating concurrently. E
 xisting diagnosis techniques are either intrusive and incur non-negligible
  performance overhead in a production environment\, or face scalability ch
 allenges when applied to complex software systems.\n\nA promising approach
  is to replicate how developers diagnose these failures. Guided by this no
 tion\, this talk will describe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, wh
 ich automate two major tasks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction an
 d root cause localization. Given the logs and code of a distributed system
  that has failed (in production)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a mi
 nimal set of operations necessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux ca
 n further pinpoint the single instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\

 s Using Programmable Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of d
 ata center network bandwidth\, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU pe
 rformance\, has challenged our conventional wisdom regarding data center n
 etworks: how to build distributed systems that can keep up with the networ
 k speeds and are high-performant and energy-efficient? The recent emergenc
 e of a programmable network fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By
  offloading suitable computations to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, recon
 figurable switch\, or network accelerator)\, one can reduce request servin
 g latency\, save end-host CPU cores\, and enable efficient traffic control
 .\n\nIn this talk\, I will present two frameworks for building PNF-enabled
  distributed systems: (1) IncBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built w
 ith network accelerators and programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-
 based framework for offloading distributed applications on SmartNICs. I wi
 ll show how to make efficient use of in-network heterogeneous computing re
 sources by applying approximation techniques\, co-designing with end-host 
 software layers\, employing new programming abstractions\, and designing e
 fficient control-/data-planes. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to 
 re-architect other data center systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. can
