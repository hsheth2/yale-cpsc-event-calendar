 r Title:  Towards Secure High-Performance Computer Architectures\n\nAbstr
 act:\n\nRecent work has shown that architectural isolation can be violated
  through software side channel attacks that exploit microarchitectural per
 formance optimizations such as speculation to leak secrets. While turning 
 off microarchitectural optimizations can preclude some classes of attacks\
 , we argue that performance and security do not have be in conflict\, prov
 ided processors are designed with security in mind.\n\nWe advocate designi
 ng processors to support enclaves\, which are processes with an associated
  security policy\, and espouse a principled hardware/software co-design ap
 proach to eliminating entire attack surfaces relevant to the security poli
 cy through microarchitectural isolation\, rather than plugging attack-spec
 ific privacy leaks. As a case study of this approach\, we describe both in
 -order and speculative processor designs that offer strong provable isolat
 ion of software modules running concurrently and sharing resources\, even 
 when large parts of the operating system are compromised. Open-source impl
 ementations of these processors will allow security properties to be indep
 endently verified. Finally\, we describe the current limitations of this a
 pproach and future opportunities for research.\n\nBio:\n\nSrini Devadas is
  the Webster Professor of EECS at MIT where he has been on the faculty sin
 ce 1988. His current research interests are in computer security\, compute
 r architecture and applied cryptography. Devadas received the 2015 ACM/IEE
 E Richard Newton award\, the 2017 IEEE W. Wallace McDowell award and the 2

 resentation Learning on Graph Structured Data: A Scalable and Hierarchical
  Perspective\n\nHost: Steven Zucker\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe ubiquity of graph 
 structures in sciences and industry necessitates effective and efficient m
 achine learning models that can capture the underlying inductive biases of
  the relational data. My research aims to learn deep representations that 
 leverage the highly complex connectivity information of the graph structur
 e\, and utilize these representations in scientific domains to make predic
 tions at the level of nodes\, links\, subgraphs and entire graphs. My rese
 arch contributes fundamental pieces of graph neural networks. In this talk
  I will focus on effective graph neural network architectures scalable to 
 billions of edges\, and well as the use of hierarchy as an inductive bias 
 in learning highly expressive representations for nodes and graphs.\n\nBio
 :\n\nRex Ying is a 5th-year PhD student in StatsML group at Stanford Unive
 rsity\, advised by Jure Leskovec. His research area spans machine learning
  on graph-structured data\, and interested in its application in physical 
 simulations\, social networks\, knowledge graphs. He pioneered key method 
 in the field of graph neural networks\, including GraphSAGE and DiffPool. 
 Recently\, he collaborated with DeepMind to use graph neural networks to l
 earn realistic and large-scale physical simulations. He also developed the
  first billion-scale graph embedding services at Pinterest. He has served 
 as committee members of AAAI\, ICML\, NeurIPS\, KDD\, WWW for 4 years\, an

 osition is that by emulating the operation of the brain’s neocortex\, a 
 spiking neural network (SNN) can achieve similar desirable features: flexi
 ble learning\, speed\, and efficiency.  Temporal neural networks (TNNs) a
 re SNNs that communicate and process information encoded as relative spike
  times (in contrast to spike rates).  A TNN architecture is proposed\, an
 d as a proof-of-concept\, TNN operation is demonstrated within the larger 
 context of online supervised classification.  First\, through unsupervise
 d learning\, a TNN partitions input patterns into clusters based on simila
 rity.  The TNN learning process adjusts synaptic weights by using only si
 gnals local to each synapse\, and global clustering behavior emerges. The 
 TNN then passes a cluster identifier to a simple online supervised decoder
  which finishes the classification task. Besides features of the overall a
 rchitecture\, several TNN components and methods are new to this work.  A
  long term research objective is a direct hardware implementation.  Conse
 quently\, the architecture is described at a level analogous to the gate a
 nd register transfer levels used in conventional digital design\, and proc
 essing is done at very low precision.\n\nBio:\n\nJames E. Smith is Profess
 or Emeritus in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at th
 e University of Wisconsin-Madison. He received his PhD from the University
  of Illinois in 1976. He then joined the faculty of the University of Wisc
 onsin-Madison\, teaching and conducting research  ̶  first in fault-tol
 erant computing\, then in computer architecture.  He has been involved in
  a number of computer research and development projects both as a faculty 
 member at Wisconsin and in industry.\n\nProf. Smith made a number of contr
 ibutions to the development of superscalar processors. These contributions
  include basic mechanisms for dynamic branch prediction and implementing p
 recise traps.  He has also studied vector processor architectures and wor
 ked on the development of innovative microarchitecture paradigms. He recei
 ved the 1999 ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchly Award for these contributions.\n\nFor

 itle: You Are What You Train On:  Creating Robust Natural Language Inte
 rfaces\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nNatural Language Interfaces
  like Siri and Alexa help people do things more efficiently\, but they are
  brittle\, unable to handle the full range of ways people naturally expres
 s themselves. Each of their actions is manually defined by developers\, wi
 th limited ability to compose actions to make more sophisticated ones. The
  choice of action is made by a statistical model that is limited by the ra
 nge of data seen in training. Despite steady progress in the accuracy of t
 hese systems\, the true scope of remaining challenges has been obscured by
  the way researchers collect and prepare data.\n\nIn this talk\, I will de
 scribe two of my projects that have revealed previously unknown limitation
 s of natural language interfaces and ways to address them. First\, I will 
 show that systems for converting questions to SQL queries have limited gen
 eralizability beyond examples seen in training (ACL 2018). I propose a new
  model and a new way to split data into training and test sets that explor
 e this challenge. Second\, I will show that standard crowd-worker data col
 lection processes miss the long and heavy tail of ways people speak (ACL 2
 017). I propose an outlier-based data collection workflow (NAACL 2019)\, a
 nd a complementary taboo list workflow (EMNLP 2020)\, that improve data di
 versity and reduce the cost of data cleaning. I will conclude by outlining
  a research agenda for fundamentally changing the capabilities of these sy
 stems. Today we use these systems to do simple tasks\, e.g. “start a 5 m
 inute timer”. My work will enable systems to do complex tasks as part of
  applications\, e.g. “Plot population over the last 2000 years with a tr
 end line only and a log scale on the y-axis”.\n\nBio:\n\nJonathan K. Kum

 tion\, and dialogue. He has proposed models and algorithms to address thes

 sing systems. He has been on the program committee for 55 conferences and

 r\, Brown University\n\nTitle:  Accurate\, Real-time Energy-efficient Sce
 ne Perception through Hardware Acceleration\n\nAbstract:\n\nTechnological 
 advancements have led to a proliferation of robots using machine learning 
 systems to assist humans in a wide range of tasks. However\, we are still 
 far from accurate\, reliable\, and resource-efficient operations of these 
 systems. Despite the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
  object recognition\, these discriminative techniques have several shortco
 mings that leave them vulnerable to exploitation from adversaries.  In ad
 dition\, the computational cost incurred to train these discriminative mod
 els can be quite significant.  Discriminative-generative approaches offer
 s a promising avenue for robust perception and action. Such methods combin
 e inference by deep learning with sampling and probabilistic inference mod
 els to achieve robust and adaptive understanding.  The focus is now on im
 plementing a computationally efficient generative inference stage that can
  achieve real-time results in an energy efficient manner.  In this talk\,
  I will present our work on Generative Robust Inference and Perception (GR
 IP)\, a discriminative-generative approach for pose estimation that offers
  high accuracy especially in unstructured and adversarial environments.  
 I will then describe how we have designed an all-hardware implementation o
 f this algorithm to obtain real-time performance with high energy-efficien
 cy.\n\nBio:\n\nR. Iris Bahar received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in compute

 Resource-Efficient Execution for Deep Learning\n\nHost: Abhishek Bhattacha
 rjee\n\nAbstract:\n\nDeep Learning models have enabled state-of-the-art re
 sults across a broad range of applications\; however\, training these mode
 ls is extremely time- and resource-intensive\, taking weeks on clusters wi
 th thousands of expensive accelerators in the extreme case. In this talk\,
  I will describe two systems that improve the resource efficiency of model
  training. The first system\, PipeDream\, proposes the use of pipelining t
 o accelerate distributed training. Pipeline parallelism facilitates model 
 training with lower communication overhead than previous methods while sti
 ll ensuring high compute resource utilization. Pipeline parallelism also e
 nables the efficient training of large models that do not fit on a single 
 worker. Pipeline parallelism is being used at Facebook\, Microsoft\, OpenA
 I\, and Nvidia for efficient large-scale model training. The second system
 \, Gavel\, determines how resources in a shared cluster with heterogeneous
  compute resources (e.g.\, different types of hardware accelerators) shoul
 d be partitioned among different users to optimize objectives specified ov
 er multiple training jobs. Gavel can improve various scheduling objectives
 \, such as average completion time\, makespan\, or cloud computing resourc
 e cost\, by up to 3.5x. I will conclude the talk with discussion on future
  directions for optimizing Machine Learning systems.\n\nBio\n:\n\n\nDeepak

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nMarios Kogias\n\nTitle: Bui
 lding Latency-Critical Datacenter Systems\n\nHost: Avi Silberschatz\n\nAbs
 tract:\n\nOnline services play a major role in our everyday life for commu
 nication\, entertainment\, socializing\, e-commerce\, etc.  These service
 s run inside the datacenter under strict tail-latency service level object
 ives in order to remain interactive. The emergence of new hardware for IO
  has enabled microsecond-scale datacenter communications that challenge th
 e efficiency of existing operating system and network mechanisms. Also\, 
 new in-network programmable devices start being deployed in datacenters an
 d introduce a new computing paradigm that shifts functionality traditional
 ly performed at the end-points to the network.\n\nIn this talk I will revi
 sit the operating systems\, networking\, and distributed systems infrastru
 cture specifically targeting latency-critical datacenter systems\, while d
 rawing intuition from basic queueing theory results. In the first part of
  the talk\, I will focus on ZygOS[SOSP 2017]\, a system optimized for μs-
 scale\, in-memory computing on multicore servers. ZygOS implements a work
 -conserving scheduler within a specialized operating system designed for h
 igh request rates and a large number of network connections. ZygOS reveal
 ed the challenges associated with serving remote procedure calls (RPCs) on
  top of a byte-stream oriented protocol\, such as TCP. In the second part
  of the talk\, I will present R2P2[ATC 2019]. R2P2 is a transport protoco
 l specifically designed for datacenter RPCs\, that exposes the RPC abstrac
 tion to the endpoints and the network\, making RPCs first-class datacenter
  citizens. R2P2 enables pushing functionality\, such as scheduling\, faul
 t-tolerance\, and tail-tolerance\, inside the transport protocol. I will 
 show how using R2P2 allowed us to offload RPC scheduling to programmable s
 witches that can schedule requests directly on individual CPU cores.\n\nBi

 ing latent structure and bisimulation metrics for better generalization in
  reinforcement learning\n\nHost: Marynel Vázquez\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe adve
 nt of deep learning has shepherded unprecedented progress in various field
 s of machine learning. Despite recent advances in deep reinforcement learn
 ing (RL) algorithms\, however\, there is no method today that exhibits any
 where near the generalization that we have seen in computer vision and NLP
 . Indeed\, one might ask whether deep RL algorithms are even capable of th
 e kind of generalization that is needed for open-world environments.  Thi
 s challenge is fundamental and will not be solved with incremental algorit
 hmic advances.\n\nIn this talk\, we propose to incorporate different assum
 ptions that better reflect the real world and allow the design of novel al
 gorithms with theoretical guarantees to address this fundamental problem. 
 We first present how state abstractions can accelerate reinforcement learn
 ing from rich observations\, such as images\, without relying either on do
 main knowledge or pixel-reconstruction. Our goal is to learn state abstrac
 tions that both provide for effective downstream control and invariance to
  task-irrelevant details. We use bisimulation metrics to quantify behavior
 al similarity between states\, and learn robust latent representations whi
 ch encode only the task-relevant information from observations. We provide
  theoretical guarantees for the learned approximate abstraction and extend
  this notion to families of tasks with varying dynamics.\n\nBio:\n\nI am a
  final year PhD candidate at McGill University and the Mila Institute\, co
 -supervised by Profs. Joelle Pineau and Doina Precup. I am also a research
 er at Facebook AI Research. My work focuses on bridging theory and practic
 e through learning approximate state abstractions and learning representat
 ions for generalization in reinforcement learning. I previously obtained a

 hitecting Quantum Computing Systems in the Presence of Noise\n\nHost: Lin 
 Zhong\n\nAbstract:\n\nQuantum computers may solve some problems beyond the
  reach of classical digital computers. However\, emerging quantum systems 
 are typically noisy and difficult to control\, leaving a significant gap b
 etween the exacting requirements of quantum applications and the realities
  of noisy devices. Bridging this gap is crucial – my work adapts convent
 ional computer systems techniques to meet the critical theoretical and exp
 erimental constraints in quantum processors. I divide my talk into three p
 arts: (i) introducing my recent work on systematic noise mitigation for su
 perconducting transmon qubits [MICRO’20]\, which enhances the robustness
  of quantum processors through coordination of control instructions\; (ii)
  demonstrating efficient and reliable quantum memory management [ISCA’20
 ]\, which implements automated tools for allocation\, reclamation and reus
 e of qubits in quantum programs\, much like in garbage collection for clas
 sical programs\; (iii) discussing on-going work on implementing quasi-faul
 t-tolerant rotation gates in quantum error correction\, which seeks to pro
 vide correctness guarantees for quantum applications by encoding quantum b
 its in a way that errors can be detected and corrected\, analogous to clas
 sical error-correcting codes.\n\nBio:\n\nYongshan Ding is a Ph.D. candidat
