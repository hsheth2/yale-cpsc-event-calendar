DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nAram-Alexandre Pooladian\n\nHost:
  Andre Wibisono\n\nTitle: Entropic estimation of optimal transport maps\n
 \nAbstract:\n\nWe develop a computationally tractable method for estimatin
 g the optimal mapbetween two distributions over R^d with rigorous finite
 -sample guarantees. Leveraging an entropic version of Brenier’s theorem
 \, we show that our estimator is easy to compute using Sinkhorn’s algor
 ithm. As a result\, unlike current approaches for map estimation\, which 
 are slow to evaluate when the dimension or number of samples is large\, o
 ur approach is parallelizable and extremely efficient even for massive da
 ta sets. Under smoothness assumptions on the optimal map\, we show that o
 ur estimator enjoys comparable statistical performance to other estimator
 s in the literature\, but with much lower computational cost. This is join
 t work with Jonathan Niles-Weed.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-
