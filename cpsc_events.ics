 in biomedical data collection allows the collection of massive datasets me
 asuring thousands of features in thousands to millions of individual cells
 . This data has the potential to advance our understanding of biological m
 echanisms at a previously impossible resolution. However\, there are few m
 ethods to understand data of this scale and type. While neural networks ha
 ve made tremendous progress on supervised learning problems\, there is sti
 ll much work to be done in making them useful for discovery in data with m
 ore difficult to represent supervision. The flexibility and expressiveness
  of neural networks is sometimes a hindrance in these less supervised doma
 ins\, as is the case when extracting knowledge from biomedical data. One t
 ype of prior knowledge that is more common in biological data comes in the
  form of geometric constraints.\n\nIn this thesis\, we aim to leverage thi
 s geometric knowledge to create scalable and interpretable models to under
 stand this data. Encoding geometric priors into neural network and graph m
 odels allows us to characterize the models’ solutions as they relate to 
 the fields of graph signal processing and optimal transport. These links a
 llow us to understand and interpret this datatype. We divide this work int
 o three sections. The first borrows concepts from graph signal processing 
 to construct more interpretable and performant neural networks by constrai
 ning and structuring the architecture. The second borrows from the theory 
 of optimal transport to perform anomaly detection and trajectory inference
  efficiently and with theoretical guarantees. The third examines how to co
 mpare distributions over an underlying manifold\, which can be used to und
 erstand how different perturbations or conditions relate. For this we desi
 gn an efficient approximation of optimal transport based on diffusion over
  a joint cell graph. Together\, these works utilize our prior understandin
 g of the data geometry to create more useful models of the data. We apply 
 these methods to molecular graphs\, images\, single-cell sequencing\, and 
 health record data.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-
