 th Vishnoi (CS) and Dan Spielman (S&DS)\n\nTitle: Designing for the Last M
 ile in Machine Learning\n\nAbstract:\n\nMachine learning is now a general-
 purpose technology. In many domains\, we can build models to support impor
 tant decisions or automate routine tasks. Yet we may not reap their benefi
 ts due to disuse\, or even inflict harm due to misuse. In this talk\, I wi
 ll present methodological advances that address these “last mile” chal
 lenges. First\, I will describe a method to learn simple risk scores that 
 are readily adopted for medical decision support\, and discuss application
 s to adult ADHD diagnosis and ICU seizure prediction. Next\, I will descri
 be how machine learning models may harm individuals in consumer-facing app
 lications by violating their right to autonomy. I will then introduce the 
 notion of “recourse” and formalize methods to prevent such harms witho
 ut interfering in model development.\n\nBio:\n\nBerk Ustun is a postdoc at
  the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society. His research 
 interests are in machine learning\, optimization\, and human-centered desi
 gn. In particular\, he focuses on developing methods to promote the adopti
 on and responsible use of machine learning in domains such as medicine\, c
 onsumer finance\, and criminal justice.\n\nBerk has built machine learning
  systems that are now used by major healthcare providers for hospital read
 missions prediction\, ICU seizure prediction\, and adult ADHD screening. H
 is work has been covered by various media outlets\, including NPR and Wire
 d\, and has won major awards\, including the INFORMS Informative Applicati
 ons in Analytics Award in 2016 and 2019\, and the INFORMS Computing Societ
 y Best Student Paper.\n\nBerk holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Co
 mputer Science from MIT\, an MS in Computation for Design and Optimization

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni
 versity and bachelor’s degrees in computer science and in economics from
  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the
  University of Washington as a postdoc. His research interests include hum
 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc
 ience. His work has been covered by many news media outlets\, such as the 
 New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won an NSF CRII award\, a 
 Salesforce research award\, a Facebook fellowship\, and a Yahoo! Key Scien
 tific Challenges award.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-che

 VIDIA\n\nHost: Man-Ki Yoon\n\nTitle: Machine Learning for Autonomous Drivi
 ng\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe NVIDIA New Jersey office is located at Bell Works i
 n Holmdel\, the former Bell Labs location where pioneering deep learning w
 ork took place from the mid 80s to the mid 90s and where the first industr
 ial deep learning product was developed\, a commercial handwritten check-r
 eading system.\n\nThe first part of this presentation will provide a recap
  of that early Bell Labs work and findings. The second part will focus on 
 today’s NVIDIA work in Holmdel on applying learning to the hard\, unsolv
 ed problems in autonomous driving.\n\nThe current work started in the Spri
 ng of 2015 with a small core team. By March 2016 the team demonstrated a c
 omplete learned driving application on local roads and highways. Since the
 n the team has grown and the capabilities of our on-road driving system ha
 ve expanded. In addition\, a simulator has been built that faithfully repr
 oduces real vehicle behavior\, allowing system testing before a real vehic
 le goes on the road.\n\nBios:\n\nLarry Jackel\nis President of North-C Tec
 hnologies\, where he does professional consulting. From 2003-2007 he was a
  DARPA Program Manager in the IPTO and TTO offices. He conceived and manag
 ed programs in Universal Network-Based Document Storage and in Autonomous 
 Ground Robot navigation and Locomotion. For most of his scientific career 
 Jackel was a manager and researcher in Bell Labs and then AT&T Labs. He ha
 s created and managed research groups in Microscience and Microfabrication
 \, in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition\, and in Carrier-Scale Tele
 com Services. Jackel holds a PhD in Experimental Physics from Cornell Univ
 ersity with a thesis in superconducting electronics. He is a Fellow of the
  American Physical Society and the IEEE.\n\nUrs Muller\njoined NVIDIA in 2
 015 to build and lead the autonomous driving team in Holmdel\, New Jersey.
  The team focuses on new learning-based robust solutions for self-driving 
 cars. Previously\, Muller worked at Bell Labs and later founded Net-Scale 
 Technologies\, Inc.\, a prime contractor for several DARPA robotics and de
 ep learning programs.\n\nThere will be a group meeting (for Q&A\, Discussi
 on)\nwith the speakers for students after the seminar.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.y

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAdji Boousso Dieng\n\nHosts
 : Holly Rushmeier (CS) and Dan Spielman (S&DS)\n\nTitle: Deep Probabilisti
 c Graphical Modeling\n\nAbstract:\n\nDeep learning (DL) is a powerful appr
 oach to modeling complex and large scale data. However\, DL models lack in
 terpretable quantities and calibrated uncertainty. In contrast\, probabili
 stic graphical modeling (PGM) provides a framework for formulating an inte
 rpretable generative process of data and a way to express uncertainty abou
 t what we do not know. How can we develop machine learning methods that br
 ing together the expressivity of DL with the interpretability and calibrat
 ion of PGM to build flexible models endowed with an interpretable latent s
 tructure that can be fit efficiently? I call this line of research deep pr
 obabilistic graphical modeling (DPGM). In this talk\, I will discuss my wo
 rk on developing DPGM for text data. In particular\, I will show how DPGM 
 enables flexible and interpretable topic modeling at large scale\, unlocki
 ng several known challenges. Furthermore\, I will describe how we can acco
 unt for both local and long-range context\, under the DPGM framework\, to 
 build a flexible sequential document model that leads to state-of-the-art 
 performance on a downstream document classification task.\n\nBio:\n\nAdji 
 Bousso Dieng is a PhD Candidate at Columbia University where she is jointl
 y advised by David Blei and John Paisley. Her research is in Artificial In
 telligence and Statistics\, bridging probabilistic graphical models and de

 ker: Nazneen Rajani\, Salesforce Research\n\nDescription:\nDeep learning m
 odels perform poorly on tasks that require commonsense reasoning\, which o
 ften necessitates some form of world knowledge or reasoning over informati
 on not immediately present in the input. In the first part of the talk\, I
  will discuss how language models can be leveraged to generate natural lan
 guage explanations which are not just interpretable but can also be used t
 o improve performance on a downstream task such as CommonsenseQA and empir
 ically show that explanations are a way to incorporate commonsense reasoni
 ng in neural networks. Further\, I will discuss how explanations can be tr
 ansferred to other tasks without fine-tuning. In the second part of the ta
 lk\, I will talk about how we can train neural networks to do commonsense 
 reasoning for qualitative physics and demonstrate on simulations involving
  physical laws such as collision\, friction\, and gravity. Our proposed fr
 amework first detects salient collisions and then generates natural langua
 ge reasoning about the events in those salient frames.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNa

 t:\n\nMachine learning has been successful and is prevalent in everyday li
 fe\, shaping many aspects of modern society. Nevertheless\, many fundament
 al questions remain\, and it is important to develop a proper theoretical 
 understanding of machine learning to guide its future development. In this
  talk I will discuss the fundamental properties of optimization\, sampling
 \, and game dynamics for machine learning. In optimization\, I will presen
 t a variational perspective on accelerated methods via the principle of le
 ast action in continuous time\, and derive new families of accelerated met
 hods which achieve faster convergence under refined smoothness conditions.
  In sampling\, I will present a study of sampling as optimization in the s
 pace of measures\, and show fast convergence of Langevin algorithms under 
 isoperimetry conditions which extend classical log-concavity results. In g
 ame dynamics\, I will present an analysis of minimax games as skew-optimiz
 ation in the space of joint configurations\, and show fast convergence of 
 the classical fictitious play algorithm and its optimistic variant under s
 moothness.\n\nBio:\n\nAndre Wibisono is a postdoctoral researcher in the S

 ccelerating Scientific Discovery\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe dramatic increase in 
 both sensor capabilities and computational power over the last few decades
  has created enormous opportunities for using machine learning (ML) to enh
 ance scientific discovery. To realize this potential\, ML systems must sea
 mlessly integrate with the key tools for scientific discovery. However\, d
 ifficult problems stand in the way of this goal. For instance\, how can we
  incorporate scientific domain knowledge within ML algorithms? How can we 
 use ML to quantify uncertainty in simulations? How can we use ML to plan e
 xperiments under real-world budget constraints?\n\nFor the above questions
 \, I’ll first present the key computational and statistical challenges t
 hrough the lens of probabilistic modeling. Next\, I’ll highlight limitat
 ions of existing approaches for scaling to high-dimensional data and prese
 nt algorithms from my research that can effectively overcome these challen
 ges. These algorithms are theoretically principled\, domain-agnostic\, and
  exhibit strong empirical performance. Notably\, I’ll describe a collabo
 ration with chemists and material scientists where we used these algorithm
 s to optimize an experimental pipeline for electric batteries and signific
 antly reduced the overall time costs from about 1.5 years to 16 days. Fina
 lly\, I’ll conclude with an overview of future opportunities for using M
 L to accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nBio:\n\nAditya Grover is a fifth-
 year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by
  Stefano Ermon. His research focuses on learning and inference algorithms 
 for probabilistic models and is grounded in applications to accelerate phy
 sical sciences. Aditya’s research has been published in top scientific a
 nd ML/AI venues (e.g.\, Nature\, NeurIPS\, ICML\, ICLR\, AAAI\, AISTATS)\,
  included in popular open source ML software\, and deployed into productio
 n at major technology companies. His work has been recognized with a best 
 paper award (StarAI)\, a Lieberman Fellowship\, a Data Science Institute S
 cholarship\, and a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship. He is also a Teach
 ing Fellow at Stanford since 2018\, where he co-created and teaches a new 
 class on Deep Generative Models. Previously\, Aditya obtained his bachelor

 arning Optimizations\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs an increasingly important workload
 \, machine learning (ML) applications require different performance optimi
 zation techniques from traditional runtimes and compilers. In particular\,
  to accelerate ML applications\, it is generally necessary to perform ML c
 omputations on heterogeneous hardware and parallelize computations using m
 ultiple data dimensions\, neither of which is even expressible in traditio
 nal compilers and runtimes. In this talk\, I will describe my work on auto
 mated discovery of performance optimizations to accelerate ML computations
 .\n\nTASO\, the Tensor Algebra SuperOptimizer\, optimizes the computation 
 graphs of deep neural networks (DNNs) by automatically generating potentia
 l graph optimizations and formally verifying their correctness. TASO outpe
 rforms rule-based graph optimizers in existing ML systems (e.g.\, TensorFl
 ow\, TensorRT\, and TVM) by up to 3x by automatically discovering novel gr
 aph optimizations\, while also requiring significantly less human effort.\
 n\nFlexFlow is a system for accelerating distributed DNN training. FlexFlo
 w identifies parallelization dimensions not considered in existing ML syst
 ems (e.g.\, TensorFlow and PyTorch) and automatically discovers fast paral
 lelization strategies for a specific parallel machine. Companies and natio
 nal labs are using FlexFlow to train production ML models that do not scal
 e well in current ML systems\, achieving over 10x performance improvement.
 \n\nI will also outline future research directions for further automating 
 ML systems\, such as codesigning ML models\, software systems\, and hardwa
 re backends for end-to-end ML deployment.\n\nBio:\n\nZhihao Jia is a Ph.D.
  candidate in the Computer Science department at Stanford University worki

 \n\nAbstract:\n\nWe use language to refer to objects like “toast”\, 
 “plate”\, and “table” and to communicate requests such as “Could
  you make breakfast?” In this talk\, I will present work on computationa
 l methods to tie language to physical\, grounded meaning. Robots are an id
 eal platform for such work because they can perceive and interact with the
  world. I will discuss dialog and learning strategies I have developed to 
 enable robots to learn from their human partners\, similar to how people l
 earn from one another through interaction. I will present methods enabling
  robots to understand language referring expressions like “the heavy\, m
 etallic mug”\, the first work showing that it is possible to learn to co
 nnect words to their perceptual properties in the visual\, tactile\, and a
 uditory senses of a physical robot. I will also present benchmarks and mod
 els for translating high-level human language like “put the toast on the
  table” that imply latent\, intermediate goals into executable sequences
  of agent actions with the help of low-level\, step-by-step language instr
 uctions. Finally\, I will discuss how my work in grounded language contrib

 e systems. 2019 has experienced noticeably more Internet outages and is so
 metimes considered as the “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failur
 es in distributed systems at data center scale is a particularly critical\
 , yet notoriously difficult task because these systems are complex: there 
 are numerous threads\, processes\, and nodes communicating concurrently. E
 xisting diagnosis techniques are either intrusive and incur non-negligible
  performance overhead in a production environment\, or face scalability ch
 allenges when applied to complex software systems.\n\nA promising approach
  is to replicate how developers diagnose these failures. Guided by this no
 tion\, this talk will describe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, wh
 ich automate two major tasks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction an
 d root cause localization. Given the logs and code of a distributed system
  that has failed (in production)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a mi
 nimal set of operations necessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux ca
 n further pinpoint the single instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\

 s Using Programmable Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of d
 ata center network bandwidth\, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU pe
 rformance\, has challenged our conventional wisdom regarding data center n
 etworks: how to build distributed systems that can keep up with the networ
 k speeds and are high-performant and energy-efficient? The recent emergenc
 e of a programmable network fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By
  offloading suitable computations to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, recon
 figurable switch\, or network accelerator)\, one can reduce request servin
 g latency\, save end-host CPU cores\, and enable efficient traffic control
 .\n\nIn this talk\, I will present two frameworks for building PNF-enabled
  distributed systems: (1) IncBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built w
 ith network accelerators and programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-
 based framework for offloading distributed applications on SmartNICs. I wi
 ll show how to make efficient use of in-network heterogeneous computing re
 sources by applying approximation techniques\, co-designing with end-host 
 software layers\, employing new programming abstractions\, and designing e
 fficient control-/data-planes. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to 
 re-architect other data center systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. can
 didate in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at th
 e University of Washington\, advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy\, Luis Ceze\,
  and Simon Peter. His research interests are in computer systems and netwo
 rks\, with a focus on optimizing distributed systems by exploring the comp
 uting capabilities across the programmable network fabric (including Smart
 NICs\, reconfigurable switches\, and network accelerators).\n\n\nhttps://c
