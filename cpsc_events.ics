DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSubhransu Maji\n\nHost: Ste
 ven Zucker\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: Task-specific Recognition
  by Modeling Visual Tasks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe AI revolution powered in par
 t by advances in deep learning has led to many successes in the last decad
 e. I’ll describe some of our work in this vein that has enabled us to in
 fer detailed properties of objects in images such as their 3D structure or
  fine-grained category within a taxonomy\, as well as study ecological phe
 nomena at an unprecedented scale using data collected from RADAR networks.
 \n\nDespite these successes\, the vast majority of important applications 
 remain beyond the scope of current AI systems. One barrier is that existin
 g algorithms lack the ability to learn from limited data. This is a fundam
 ental challenge because real-world data is dynamic\, heavy-tailed\, where 
 supervision can be hard to acquire. I argue that a principled framework fo
 r reasoning about AI problems can enable modular and data-efficient soluti
 ons.\n\nTowards this end I will describe our framework for embedding compu
 ter vision tasks into a vector space that allows us to learn and reason ab
 out their properties. Our approach represents a task as the Fisher informa
 tion of the parameters of a generic “probe” network. We show that the 
 distance between these vectors correlates with natural metrics over tasks.
  It is also predictive of transfer\, i.e.\, how much does training a deep 
 network on one task benefit another\, and can be used for model recommenda
 tion. On a portfolio of hundreds of vision tasks the recommended network u
 sing our approach outperforms the current gold standard of fine-tuning an 
 ImageNet pre-trained network\, especially when training data is limited.\n
 \nI’ll conclude with some of the life-cycle challenges that we need to a
 ddress to make AI systems widely applicable.\n\nBio:\n\nI am an Assistant 
 Professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the Unive
 rsity of Massachusetts Amherst where I co-direct the Computer Vision Lab. 
 I am also affiliated with the Center of Data Science and AWS AI. Prior to 
 this I was a Research Assistant Professor at TTI Chicago\, a philanthropic
 ally endowed academic institute in the University of Chicago campus. I obt
 ained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Be
 rkeley in 2011 and B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Ka
 npur in 2006. For my work\, I have received a Google graduate fellowship\,
  NSF CAREER Award (2018)\, and a best paper honorable mention at CVPR 2018
 . I also serve on the editorial board of the International Journal of Comp
 uter Vision (IJCV).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-subhran

  Theoretical Reflections on Quantum Supremacy\n\nHost: Nisheeth Vishnoi\n
 \nAbstract:\n\nThe recent demonstration of quantum supremacy by Google is 
 a first step towards the era of small to medium scale quantum computers. I
 n this talk I will explain what the experiment accomplished and the theore

 nel Vazquez\n\nCoffee available at 10:15\n\nTitle: Data-driven Computation
 al Studio\n\nAbstract:\n\nHuman life is composed of moments and experience
 s. Imagine going back in time and revisiting crucial moments of your life\
 , such as your wedding ceremony\, or the first birthday of your child\, as
  if you are present at the moment\; Or picture Abraham Lincoln delivering 
 the Gettysburg Address and telling you the story of the American Civil War
 . These phenomena are currently limited to human imagination alone. A comp
 utational machinery that can understand and create a four-dimensional audi
 o-visual world can enable humans to realize their vision and share it with
  others. In this talk\, I will introduce my research on the Computational 
 Studio that allows average humans to relive old memories like a virtual ti
 me travel\, automatically create new experiences\, and express themselves 
 using everyday computational devices audio-visually. In the first part of 
 the talk\, I will describe my work on capturing and browsing 4D audio-visu
 al world and efforts on building a multi-robot capture system. The applica
 tions of this work transcend virtualized reality to digitize intangible cu
 ltural heritage\, capture tribal dances and wildlife in natural environmen
 t\, and understand the social behavior of human beings. I will then presen
 t my research on synthesizing the audio-visual world in an unsupervised ma
 nner. Finally\, I will demonstrate the importance of thinking about a huma
 n user and computational devices when designing content creation applicati
 ons.\n\nBio:\n\nAayush Bansal is a Ph.D. candidate at the Robotics Institu

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSanidhya Kashyap\n\nHost: A
 bhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nCoffee available at 3:45\n\nTitle: Scalable Synch
 ronization Mechanisms for Many-core Operating Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith
  the increasing demand for big data processing\, we have seen tremendous g
 rowth in the adoption and commoditization of many-core machines that span 
 beyond hundreds of hardware threads over the past decade. Even cloud provi
 ders are offering such large machines to allow users to process data as qu
 ickly as possible. To efficiently utilize such resources\, developers rely
  on various synchronization mechanisms as essential building blocks for de
 signing high-performance many-core applications.\n\nIn this talk\, I will 
 focus on designing new synchronization mechanisms for highly concurrent so
 ftware: the operating system. First\, I will show that existing locking pr
 imitives are a big deterrent to the scalability of the operating system. T
 hen\, I will present a new methodology to build scalable and practical loc
 king algorithms that break the decade-old convention of coupling lock’s 
 hardware/software policies and implementation. The family of locks I propo
 se\, not only have the least memory footprint but also the highest through
 put for any thread count. Second\, I will present another scalability prob
 lem that occurs in existing timestamp-based algorithms\, such as concurren
 cy control mechanisms and concurrent data structure frameworks. I will add
 ress this issue with a scalable timestamping primitive by providing an ill
 usion of a global clock\, thereby making such algorithms many-core friendl
 y. Finally\, I will end the talk with my vision for building evolving serv
 ices for operating systems to incorporate the fast-changing hardware as we
 ll as software.\n\nBio:\n\nSanidhya Kashyap is a Ph.D. candidate in the Sc

 stems software. His thesis focuses on revisiting the design of synchroniza
 tion primitives and their impact across software stack. His works have won
  two best paper awards and found more than 250 bugs in the Linux file syst
 ems.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-sanidhya-kashyap

 ile in Machine Learning\n\nAbstract:\n\nMachine learning is now a general-
 purpose technology. In many domains\, we can build models to support impor
 tant decisions or automate routine tasks. Yet we may not reap their benefi
 ts due to disuse\, or even inflict harm due to misuse. In this talk\, I wi
 ll present methodological advances that address these “last mile” chal
 lenges. First\, I will describe a method to learn simple risk scores that 
 are readily adopted for medical decision support\, and discuss application
 s to adult ADHD diagnosis and ICU seizure prediction. Next\, I will descri
 be how machine learning models may harm individuals in consumer-facing app
 lications by violating their right to autonomy. I will then introduce the 
 notion of “recourse” and formalize methods to prevent such harms witho
 ut interfering in model development.\n\nBio:\n\nBerk Ustun is a postdoc at
  the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society. His research 
 interests are in machine learning\, optimization\, and human-centered desi
 gn. In particular\, he focuses on developing methods to promote the adopti
 on and responsible use of machine learning in domains such as medicine\, c
 onsumer finance\, and criminal justice.\n\nBerk has built machine learning
  systems that are now used by major healthcare providers for hospital read
 missions prediction\, ICU seizure prediction\, and adult ADHD screening. H
 is work has been covered by various media outlets\, including NPR and Wire
 d\, and has won major awards\, including the INFORMS Informative Applicati

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni
 versity and bachelor’s degrees in computer science and in economics from
  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the

 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc

 c Graphical Modeling\n\nAbstract:\n\nDeep learning (DL) is a powerful appr
 oach to modeling complex and large scale data. However\, DL models lack in
 terpretable quantities and calibrated uncertainty. In contrast\, probabili
 stic graphical modeling (PGM) provides a framework for formulating an inte
 rpretable generative process of data and a way to express uncertainty abou
 t what we do not know. How can we develop machine learning methods that br
 ing together the expressivity of DL with the interpretability and calibrat
 ion of PGM to build flexible models endowed with an interpretable latent s
 tructure that can be fit efficiently? I call this line of research deep pr
 obabilistic graphical modeling (DPGM). In this talk\, I will discuss my wo
 rk on developing DPGM for text data. In particular\, I will show how DPGM 
 enables flexible and interpretable topic modeling at large scale\, unlocki
 ng several known challenges. Furthermore\, I will describe how we can acco
 unt for both local and long-range context\, under the DPGM framework\, to 
 build a flexible sequential document model that leads to state-of-the-art 
 performance on a downstream document classification task.\n\nBio:\n\nAdji

 reasoning for qualitative physics and demonstrate on simulations involving
  physical laws such as collision\, friction\, and gravity. Our proposed fr

 ccelerating Scientific Discovery\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe dramatic increase in 
 both sensor capabilities and computational power over the last few decades
  has created enormous opportunities for using machine learning (ML) to enh
 ance scientific discovery. To realize this potential\, ML systems must sea
 mlessly integrate with the key tools for scientific discovery. However\, d
 ifficult problems stand in the way of this goal. For instance\, how can we
  incorporate scientific domain knowledge within ML algorithms? How can we 
 use ML to quantify uncertainty in simulations? How can we use ML to plan e
 xperiments under real-world budget constraints?\n\nFor the above questions
 \, I’ll first present the key computational and statistical challenges t
 hrough the lens of probabilistic modeling. Next\, I’ll highlight limitat
 ions of existing approaches for scaling to high-dimensional data and prese
 nt algorithms from my research that can effectively overcome these challen
 ges. These algorithms are theoretically principled\, domain-agnostic\, and
  exhibit strong empirical performance. Notably\, I’ll describe a collabo
 ration with chemists and material scientists where we used these algorithm
 s to optimize an experimental pipeline for electric batteries and signific
 antly reduced the overall time costs from about 1.5 years to 16 days. Fina
 lly\, I’ll conclude with an overview of future opportunities for using M
 L to accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nBio:\n\nAditya Grover is a fifth-

 arning Optimizations\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs an increasingly important workload
 \, machine learning (ML) applications require different performance optimi
 zation techniques from traditional runtimes and compilers. In particular\,
  to accelerate ML applications\, it is generally necessary to perform ML c
 omputations on heterogeneous hardware and parallelize computations using m
 ultiple data dimensions\, neither of which is even expressible in traditio
 nal compilers and runtimes. In this talk\, I will describe my work on auto
 mated discovery of performance optimizations to accelerate ML computations
 .\n\nTASO\, the Tensor Algebra SuperOptimizer\, optimizes the computation 
 graphs of deep neural networks (DNNs) by automatically generating potentia
 l graph optimizations and formally verifying their correctness. TASO outpe
 rforms rule-based graph optimizers in existing ML systems (e.g.\, TensorFl
 ow\, TensorRT\, and TVM) by up to 3x by automatically discovering novel gr
 aph optimizations\, while also requiring significantly less human effort.\
 n\nFlexFlow is a system for accelerating distributed DNN training. FlexFlo
 w identifies parallelization dimensions not considered in existing ML syst
 ems (e.g.\, TensorFlow and PyTorch) and automatically discovers fast paral
 lelization strategies for a specific parallel machine. Companies and natio
 nal labs are using FlexFlow to train production ML models that do not scal
 e well in current ML systems\, achieving over 10x performance improvement.
 \n\nI will also outline future research directions for further automating 
 ML systems\, such as codesigning ML models\, software systems\, and hardwa
 re backends for end-to-end ML deployment.\n\nBio:\n\nZhihao Jia is a Ph.D.
  candidate in the Computer Science department at Stanford University worki
 ng with Alex Aiken and Matei Zaharia. His research interests lie in the in
 tersection of computer systems and machine learning\, with a focus on buil
 ding efficient\, scalable\, and high-performance systems for ML computatio

  Diagnosis for Distributed Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed software sy
 stems have become the backbone of Internet services. Consequently\, Failur
 es in production distributed systems have severe consequences. A 63-minute
  outage of Amazon in 2018 caused a 100-million loss in revenue. Moreover\,
  the frequency of failures rises with the increasing complexity of softwar
 e systems. 2019 has experienced noticeably more Internet outages and is so
 metimes considered as the “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failur
 es in distributed systems at data center scale is a particularly critical\
 , yet notoriously difficult task because these systems are complex: there 
 are numerous threads\, processes\, and nodes communicating concurrently. E
 xisting diagnosis techniques are either intrusive and incur non-negligible
  performance overhead in a production environment\, or face scalability ch
 allenges when applied to complex software systems.\n\nA promising approach
  is to replicate how developers diagnose these failures. Guided by this no
 tion\, this talk will describe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, wh
 ich automate two major tasks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction an
 d root cause localization. Given the logs and code of a distributed system
  that has failed (in production)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a mi
 nimal set of operations necessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux ca
 n further pinpoint the single instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\

 s Using Programmable Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of d
 ata center network bandwidth\, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU pe
 rformance\, has challenged our conventional wisdom regarding data center n
 etworks: how to build distributed systems that can keep up with the networ
 k speeds and are high-performant and energy-efficient? The recent emergenc
 e of a programmable network fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By
  offloading suitable computations to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, recon
 figurable switch\, or network accelerator)\, one can reduce request servin
 g latency\, save end-host CPU cores\, and enable efficient traffic control
 .\n\nIn this talk\, I will present two frameworks for building PNF-enabled
  distributed systems: (1) IncBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built w
 ith network accelerators and programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-
 based framework for offloading distributed applications on SmartNICs. I wi
 ll show how to make efficient use of in-network heterogeneous computing re
 sources by applying approximation techniques\, co-designing with end-host 
 software layers\, employing new programming abstractions\, and designing e
 fficient control-/data-planes. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to 
 re-architect other data center systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. can
 didate in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at th
 e University of Washington\, advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy\, Luis Ceze\,
  and Simon Peter. His research interests are in computer systems and netwo
 rks\, with a focus on optimizing distributed systems by exploring the comp
 uting capabilities across the programmable network fabric (including Smart
 NICs\, reconfigurable switches\, and network accelerators).\n\n\nhttps://c
