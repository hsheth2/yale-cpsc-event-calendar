DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nHost: Ruzica Piskac\n\nTitle: Towards Crea
 ting Correct Numerics\n\nAbstract:\n\nNumeric application is an integral p
 art of computer science. Real number computations are becoming increasingl
 y important with the rapid development of machine learning\, high-performa
 nce computing\, and simulations. However\, accurate and efficient numerica
 l computations are still open research areas. A problem as simple as effic
 iently and correctly approximating elementary functions is still challengi
 ng and mainstream math libraries do not produce correct results.\n\nThis t
 alk presents several challenges in numerical computation and proposes the 
 RLibm project. This project builds efficient correctly rounded elementary 
 functions for multiple representations. It makes a case for approximating 
 the correctly rounded results of an elementary function rather than the re
 al value of an elementary function. The talk then explores how this approa
 ch can be applied broadly and discuss future directions to take another st
 ep toward correct numerics.\n\nBio:\n\nJay Lim is a Lecturer at Yale Uni
 versity. He received his PhD at Rutgers University under Santosh Nagarakat
 te. His research interest lies in making all low-level systems correct and
  secure. These systems include but are not limited to compilers\, cryptog
 raphic algorithms\, standard libraries\, numerical applications\, and ML. 
 His dream is to see the day that all systems are free of bugs.\n\n\n\n\nht

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n\n\nCS Talk\nQuanquan Liu\n\nHost: Holly R
 ushmeier\n\nTitle: Scalable Graph Algorithms: Parallel\, Dynamic\, and Pri
 vate\n\nAbstract:\n\nGraph algorithms are ubiquitous in today’s world wh
 ere graph analytics are performed over massive datasets containing potenti
 ally sensitive information. Modern graphs present many new challenges not 
 considered by classic static\, sequential computation models. First\, grap
 hs have up to trillions of edges and are several orders of magnitude large
 r than what traditional sequential algorithms can handle. In addition to s
 cale\, modern graphs are also dynamically evolving with up to millions of 
 changes per second. Second\, data leaks and commercial data trading threat
 en to expose the large volume of sensitive private information contained i
 n these graphs. Third\, the monetary and resource incentives associated wi
 th large distributed graphs (e.g.\, for cryptocurrency) make them vulnerab
 le to malicious adversaries. Thus\, modern graph algorithms must achieve s
 everal simultaneous goals: efficiency\, scalability\, privacy\, and robust
 ness against adversaries.\n\nIn this talk\, I will present algorithms that
  rise to these aforementioned challenges. I will first present novel scala
 ble algorithms for k-core decomposition and related important problems in 
 computational models that take advantage of modern parallel computing arch
 itectures and dynamic environments. These algorithms not only achieve theo
 retical improvements but also hundreds of times speedups over the state-of
 -the-art in practice. Then\, I will formalize models and give algorithms t
 hat combat broader societal concerns of privacy breaches and susceptibilit
 y to adversarial attacks. Finally\, I’ll discuss my broader research vis
 ion in combining scalability with adversary-robustness.\n\nBio:\n\nQuanqua
 n C. Liu is a postdoctoral scholar at Northwestern University advised by S
 amir Khuller. She completed her PhD in Computer Science at MIT where she w
 as advised by Erik D. Demaine and Julian Shun. Before that\, she obtained 
 her dual bachelor’s degree in computer science and math also at MIT. She
  has worked on a number of problems in algorithms and the intersection bet
 ween theory and practice. Her most recent work focuses on parallel dynamic
  and static graph algorithms as well as differentially private graph algor
 ithms. She has earned the Best Paper Award at SPAA 2022\, a NSF Graduate R
 esearch Fellowship\, and participated in the 2021 EECS Rising Stars worksh
 op.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-quanquan-liu
