  Virtual Avatars\n\nAbstract:\n\nRapid advances in graphics and virtual re
 ality are bringing us to the cusp of hyper-realistic digital virtual avata
 rs. A key component in creating compelling virtual avatars is the level of
  detail in the eyes. Built in eye trackers offers technologists ample oppo
 rtunity to image the user’s eyes. Though this information provides us wi
 th the data needed to cross the uncanny valley\, collecting such data at s
 cale creates a hidden cost for the user: security and privacy vulnerabilit
 ies. In this talk\, I will discuss our work on creating avatar eyes\, demo
 nstrate a key vulnerability in eye tracking\, and present technological so
 lutions that trade off security considerations with avatar realism.\n\nBio
