 shmeier\n\nTitle: Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction Meets Stochastic Vari
 ance-Reduced Gradient Methods\n\nAbstract:\n\nPlug-and-play (PnP) methods 
 have recently emerged as a powerful framework for image reconstruction tha
 t can flexibly combine different physics-based observation models with dat
 a-driven image priors in the form of denoisers\, and achieve state-of-the-
 art image reconstruction quality in many applications. In this work\, we a
 im to further improve the computational efficacy of PnP methods by designi
 ng a new algorithm that makes use of stochastic variance-reduced gradients
  (SVRG)\, a nascent idea to accelerate runtime in stochastic optimization.
  Compared with existing PnP methods using batch gradients or stochastic gr
 adients\, the new algorithm\, called PnP-SVRG\, achieves comparable or bet
 ter accuracy of image reconstruction at a much faster computational speed.
  Extensive numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the benefits 
 of the proposed algorithm through the application of phase retrieval in co
 njunction with a wide variety of popular image denoisers.\n\nBio:\n\nVince
 nt Monardo is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering D
 epartment at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. Yuejie Chi. Vincent
  received his BSE with Honors in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State
  University with a Minor in Applied Mathematics. Vincent’s research inte
 rests lie in the domain of designing and analyzing efficient algorithms fo
 r solving inverse problems–especially within the realm of image reconstr
 uction–which improve upon the computational and statistical performance 
 of state-of-the-art methods. In the future\, Vincent is motivated to teach
  future generations the beauty of machine learning–in 2019\, he received
  the CMU ECE Outstanding Teaching Award. In his spare time\, Vincent enjoy
 s trivia\, crosswords\, music\, and rock climbing.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nIrene Li\n\nTitle: N
 eural Graph Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing Tasks\n\nAdvi
 sor: Dragomir Radev\n\nOther committee members:\nMarynel Vázquez\nYang Ca
 i\nElisa Celis\n\nAbstract:\n\nNatural language is essential in our daily 
 lives as we rely on languages to communicate and exchange information. A f
 undamental goal for natural language processing (NLP) is to let the machin
 e understand natural language to help or replace human experts to mine kno
 wledge and complete tasks.\n\nMany NLP tasks deal with sequential data. Fo
 r example\, a sentence is considered as a sequence of works. However\, not
  all tasks can be formulated using sequence models. Specifically\, graph-s
 tructured data is also fundamental in NLP\, including entity linking\, ent
 ity classification\, relation extraction\, abstractive meaning representat
 ion\, and knowledge graphs. In this scenario\,  BERT-based pretrained mod
 els may not be suitable. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is a dee
 p neural network model designed for graphs. It has shown great potential i
 n text classification\, link prediction\, question answering and so on.\n\
 nThis dissertation presents novel graph models for NLP tasks\, including t
 ext classification\, prerequisite chain learning\, and coreference resolut
 ion. We focus on different perspectives of graph convolutional network mod
 eling: for text classification\, a novel graph construction method is prop
 osed which allows interpretability for the prediction\; for prerequisite c
 hain learning\, we propose multiple aggregation functions that utilize nei
 ghbors for better information exchange\; for coreference resolution\, we s
 tudy how graph pretraining can help when labeled data is limited. Moreover
 \, an important branch is to apply pretrained language models for the ment
 ioned tasks. So\, this dissertation also focuses on the transfer learning 
 method that generalizes pretrained models to other domains\, including med
 ical\, cross-lingual\, and web data. Finally\, we propose a new task calle
 d unsupervised cross-domain prerequisite chain learning\, and study novel 
 graph-based methods to transfer knowledge over graphs.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.y
