 gomir Radev\n\nLanguage Grounding with Robots\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe use langu
 age to refer to objects like “toast”\, “plate”\, and “table” a
 nd to communicate requests such as “Could you make breakfast?” In this
  talk\, I will present work on computational methods to tie language to ph
 ysical\, grounded meaning. Robots are an ideal platform for such work beca
 use they can perceive and interact with the world. I will discuss dialog a
 nd learning strategies I have developed to enable robots to learn from the
 ir human partners\, similar to how people learn from one another through i
 nteraction. I will present methods enabling robots to understand language 
 referring expressions like “the heavy\, metallic mug”\, the first work
  showing that it is possible to learn to connect words to their perceptual
  properties in the visual\, tactile\, and auditory senses of a physical ro
 bot. I will also present benchmarks and models for translating high-level 
 human language like “put the toast on the table” that imply latent\, i
 ntermediate goals into executable sequences of agent actions with the help
  of low-level\, step-by-step language instructions. Finally\, I will discu
 ss how my work in grounded language contributes to NLP\, robotics\, and th
 e broader goals of the AI community.\n\nBio:\n\nJesse Thomason is a postdo
 ctoral researcher at the University of Washington working with Luke Zettle
 moyer. He received his PhD from the University of Texas at Austin with Ray
 mond Mooney. His research focuses on language grounding and natural langua
 ge processing applications for robotics (RoboNLP). Key to this work is usi
 ng dialog with humans to facilitate both robot task execution and learning
  to enable lifelong improvement of robots’ language understanding capabi
 lities. He has worked to encourage and promote work in RoboNLP through wor
 kshop organization at both NLP and robotics conference venues.\n\n\nhttps:

 ystems\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed software systems have become the backbo
 ne of Internet services. Consequently\, Failures in production distributed
  systems have severe consequences. A 63-minute outage of Amazon in 2018 ca
 used a 100-million loss in revenue. Moreover\, the frequency of failures r
 ises with the increasing complexity of software systems. 2019 has experien
 ced noticeably more Internet outages and is sometimes considered as the 
 “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failures in distributed systems 
 at data center scale is a particularly critical\, yet notoriously difficul
 t task because these systems are complex: there are numerous threads\, pro
 cesses\, and nodes communicating concurrently. Existing diagnosis techniqu
 es are either intrusive and incur non-negligible performance overhead in a
  production environment\, or face scalability challenges when applied to c
 omplex software systems.\n\nA promising approach is to replicate how devel
 opers diagnose these failures. Guided by this notion\, this talk will desc
 ribe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, which automate two major tas
 ks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction and root cause localization.
  Given the logs and code of a distributed system that has failed (in produ
 ction)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a minimal set of operations ne
 cessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux can further pinpoint the sin
 gle instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\n\nYongle Zhang is a PhD c
 andidate in the Distributed Systems Research Group at the University of To
 ronto\, working with Prof. Ding Yuan. His research interest is in systems 
 software with a focus on improving the reliability and availability of com
 plex\, real-world systems.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloqu

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nMing Liu\n\nHost: Anurag Kh

 s\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of data center network bandwidth
 \, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU performance\, has challenged o
 ur conventional wisdom regarding data center networks: how to build distri
 buted systems that can keep up with the network speeds and are high-perfor
 mant and energy-efficient? The recent emergence of a programmable network 
 fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By offloading suitable computa
 tions to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, reconfigurable switch\, or networ
 k accelerator)\, one can reduce request serving latency\, save end-host CP
 U cores\, and enable efficient traffic control.\n\nIn this talk\, I will p
 resent two frameworks for building PNF-enabled distributed systems: (1) In
 cBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built with network accelerators and
  programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-based framework for offloadi
 ng distributed applications on SmartNICs. I will show how to make efficien
 t use of in-network heterogeneous computing resources by applying approxim
 ation techniques\, co-designing with end-host software layers\, employing 
 new programming abstractions\, and designing efficient control-/data-plane
 s. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to re-architect other data cent
 er systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Paul G. Allen 
 School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington\,
  advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy\, Luis Ceze\, and Simon Peter. His resear
 ch interests are in computer systems and networks\, with a focus on optimi
 zing distributed systems by exploring the computing capabilities across th
 e programmable network fabric (including SmartNICs\, reconfigurable switch
 es\, and network accelerators).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloq
