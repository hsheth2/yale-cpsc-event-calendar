DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nZeyu Wang\n\nTitle: 
 Enhancing the Creative Process in Digital Prototyping\n\nAdvisor: Julie Do
 rsey\n\nOther Committee Members:\nHolly Rushmeier\nSteven Zucker\nLeonard 
 McMillan (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nDespite advances in computer-aided design (CAD) systems and video editing
  software\, digital content creation for design\, storytelling\, and inter
 active experiences remains a challenging problem. This dissertation introd
 uces a series of studies\, techniques\, and systems along three thrusts th
 at engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in author
 ing digital content.\n\nFirst\, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotem
 poral analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing trac
 ing\, freehand drawing\, and computer-generated approximations. We found a
  high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used o
 ver time\, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emula
 ting drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique fo
 r line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models\, where our learned style
  space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line draw
 ing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.\n\nS
 econd\, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the 
 creative process in augmented reality through two tablet-based interfaces.
  DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for r
 emote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes\, such as D
 ollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing 
 in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in th
 eir spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the poin
 t cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more
  accessible and versatile.\n\nLast\, we introduce two procedural methods t
 o generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. Ani
 Code supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animati
 ons in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates vi
 deo flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D da
 ta for cultural heritage. Our user studies show that these methods can ben
 efit the video-oriented digital prototyping experience and facilitate the 
 dissemination of creative and cultural ideas.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/e

 f  Based on VOLE\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\nRecent works on interactive zero-k
 nowledge (ZK) protocols provide a new paradigm with high efficiency and sc
 alability. However\, these protocols suffer from high communication overhe
 ad\, often linear to the circuit size. In this talk\, I will first revisit
  prior state-of-the-art VOLE-based ZK protocol Quicksilver. Then I will co
 ver our new protocol Antman\, which is the first VOLE-based ZK protocol th
 at achieves communication overhead sublinear to the circuit size\, while m
 aintaining a similar level of computational efficiency.\n\nQuicksilver:\n\

 ent of Computer Science in Northwestern University. He is advised by Profe
 ssor Xiao Wang. His research focuses on secure multi-party computation and
  zero-knowledge proofs. His prior works include concrete security analysis
  of the garbled circuits protocol\, efficient correlated oblivious transfe
 r and VOLE-based zero-knowledge proofs. He was a research intern at Micros
 oft Research in 2021 and is currently a summer associate at the cryptograp

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJason Weston\, Facebook AI
  & NYU Visiting Research Professor\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nTitle: A jou
 rney from ML and NNs to NLP and Beyond: Just more of the same isn’t enou
 gh?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe first half of the talk will look back on the las
 t two decades of machine learning\, neural network and natural language pr
 ocessing research for dialogue\, through my personal lens\, to discuss the
  advances that have been made and the circumstances in which they happened
  – to try to give clues of what we should be working on for the future. 
 The second half will dive deeper into some current first steps in those fu
 ture directions\, in particular trying to fix the problems of neural gener
 ative models to enable deeper reasoning with short and long-term coherence
 \, and to ground such dialogue agents to an environment where they can act
  and learn. We will argue that just scaling up current techniques\, while 
 a worthy investigation\, will not be enough to solve these problems.\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJoohyung Kim\, University o
 f Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nHost: Marynel Vazquez\n\nTitle: Towards 
 Human-Friendly Robots\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe demand for robots which can work
  closely and interact physically with human has been growing. Such robots 
 can already be found guiding\, serving\, and entertaining people in some p
 laces\, such as airports\, restaurants\, and amusement parks. However\, de
 spite advances in related technologies\, there are very few robotic applic
 ations to meet the public’s expectations. To make robots help humans in 
 daily life\, we need better understanding of human evironments and tasks\,
  better methods to perform the tasks through robots\, and better design to
  interact with human naturally and safely. In this talk\, I will present m
 y works and experience to make human-friendly robots by means of robot des
 ign\, motion control\, and human-robot interaction.\n\nBio:\n\nJoohyung Ki
 m is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineeri
 ng in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on 
 design and control for humanoid robots\, system for motion learning in rob
 ot hardware\, and safe human-robot interaction. He received BSE and Ph.D. 
 degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Seoul N
 ational University\, Korea\, in 2001 and 2012. He was with Disney Research
  as a Research Scientist from 2013 to 2019. Prior to joining Disney\, he w
 as a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon Univ
 ersity for DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2013. From 2009 to 2012\, he was a 
 Research Staff Member in Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\, Korea\
 , developing biped walking controllers for humanoid robots.\n\n\nhttps://c
