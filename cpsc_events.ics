 er\n\nTitle: Understanding Recursion Without First Understanding Recursion
 : A Client-View-First Approach\n\nAbstract:\n\nConventional wisdom states 
 that “to understand recursion\, you must first understand recursion.” 
 But is that really true? This lecture explores recursion from a client-vie
 w-first perspective and examines a sound methodology to develop and reason
  about recursive algorithms without a need to understand the execution mod
 el of the programming language under discussion. The seminar begins with a
  discussion of design-by-contract principles and a formal approach to spec
 ifying and reasoning about the behavior of operations before proceeding to
  a conversation about using such specifications to develop elegant recursi
 ve solutions to a variety of problems.\n\nBio:\n\nAlan Weide received his 
 PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University in 
 December 2021\, where he also earned his Master’s degree in 2020 and Bac
 helor’s in 2015. Alan’s dissertation was completed under the supervisi
 on of Dr. Paolo Sivilotti and explores ways to apply the principles of mod
 ularity and data abstraction to parallel and concurrent programs\, and how
  to reason formally about such programs. As a graduate student\, he taught
  a course on object-oriented programming and software engineering in Java 
 and was awarded the Eleanor Quinlan Graduate Teaching Award in 2019 for hi
 s service. His teaching interests span a variety of topics including intro
 ductory computer science\, software engineering\, programming languages\, 
 algorithms\, and theoretical computer science. Beyond research and teachin
 g\, Alan enjoys playing trombone (he was a member of the OSU Marching Band
  from 2013–2018)\, exploring world cuisines\, and—despite growing up i
 n flat\, landlocked Columbus\, OH—outdoor activities such as hiking\, ka
 yaking\, and skiing.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-alan-weide

 em?\n\nAbstract:\n\nFor over 50 years\, computer scientists have battled t
 he P vs NP question. We do not appear to be much closer than where we star
 ted. The P vs NP question can be re-stated as the question of “is Circui
 t-SAT (or 3-SAT) solvable in polynomial time?” Though we have not yet ev
 en been able to prove that there is not even a linear-time algorithm for 
 Circuit-SAT\, we do know some modest impossibility results. Interestingly\
 , one can show that algorithms which are restricted to a small amount of m
 emory cannot solve Circuit-SAT in much faster than quadratic (n^2) time! I
 n this talk\, we give an overview of these modest impossibility results\, 
 and we juxtapose them with a theorem about the minimum circuit size proble
 m (MCSP)\, showing that significantly weaker impossibility results for MCS
 P would resolve the P vs NP question outright.\n\nBio:\n\nI grew up in Geo
 rgia\, and I graduated from Georgia Tech with a BSc in Computer Science an
 d a BSc in Discrete Mathematics. I spent the following Summer teaching Alg
 orithms at Georgia Tech\, and then I went to start my PhD at Stanford. I l
 eft with an MS in CS when my advisor and I moved to MIT\, where I graduate
 d with my PhD. I’ve since been a visiting professor at Oberlin College.\

  using Machine Learning and Multipath\nNetwork Protocol by Sohee Kim Park\
 n\nAbstract:\n\nResearch interest has been significantly emerged in stream
 ing 360◦ videos over the Internet to provide an immersive experience to 
 the users. A major challenge of streaming such videos is that the amount o
 f video data to be streamed could be an order of magnitude larger than con
 ventional videos to achieve a similar viewing experience. The reason for t
 his is that conventional streaming solutions fetch the entire panoramic sc
 ene\, while the user views only a small part of the scene depending on his
 /her viewing direction in 360◦ videos.\n\nIn this talk\, I will present 
 my research on advancing the user quality of experience (QoE) on 360◦ vi
 deo streaming using deep learning techniques and network protocol innovati
 ons. In the first part of the talk\, I propose a system called Mosaic\, wh
 ich utilizes deep learning techniques to predict user’s viewing directio
 n and uses a knapsack-based rate adaptation algorithm such that it maximiz
 es the user-perceived video bitrates given available network capacity. In 
 Mosaic+\, I further improve the user QoE by utilizing a more representativ
 e metric of QoE as opposed to only the bitrates as in Mosaic.\n\nIn the se
 cond part of the talk\, I will present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based
  adaptive  streaming framework\, called ATRIA\, which further improves th
 e adaptiveness to the network and user behaviors by exploiting the sequent
 ial decision-making nature of video streaming techniques. I will share how
  I address the challenges of using RL in this scenario\, such as large act
 ion space and delayed reward evaluation.\n\nIn the last part of this talk\
 , I will address the limited bandwidth issue by aggregating multiple netwo
 rk paths and using related transport layer innovations. With an early prom
 ise of my work that viewport prediction and rate adaptation work well for 
 videos not used for training\, I will conclude by describing avenues for f
 uture work\, including improving the QoE of applications that offer immers
 ive user experience with omnidirectional 360° images\, unlocking the othe
 r bandwidth-hungry delay-sensitive applications to Machine Learning and Ne
 twork Innovations.\n\nBio:\n\nSohee Kim Park is a Vice President of Inteli
 bs\, Inc.\, an incubator company at CEWIT (Center of Excellence in Wireles
 s and Information Technology) at Stony Brook University’s R&D Park. Befo
 re joining Intelibs\, she worked for Verizon Wireless\, Triveni Digital\, 
 Siemens Cooperate Research\, and TongYang SHL System House. She received h
 er Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stony Brook University. Previously\, she r
 eceived her M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Yale University and  Y
 onsei University\, respectively.\n\nHer research interests are designing a
 nd developing systems on theoretically sound principles\, applying data sc
 ience\, machine learning\, AI\, and network protocol innovations to advanc
 e the user QoE and improve system performance over the wireless network. S
 he emphasizes making such  solutions deployable and scalable with commerc
 ialization in mind. Her research is published in proceedings of the IEEE S
 arnoff Symposium\, IFIP Networking\, IEEE WACV\, and IEEE TNSM. As a seaso
 ned entrepreneur\, her extensive experiences in technology commercializati
 on include distributed antenna systems deployed at multiple university cam
 puses and hospitals and GPS products for nationwide wireless carriers.\n\n
 She is passionate about preparing leaders for the next generation\, develo
 ping technology that improves our quality of life\, and partnering with No
 n-Profit Organizations to reach out to people in need.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.y

 ance-Reduced Gradient Methods\n\nAbstract:\n\nPlug-and-play (PnP) methods 
 have recently emerged as a powerful framework for image reconstruction tha
 t can flexibly combine different physics-based observation models with dat
 a-driven image priors in the form of denoisers\, and achieve state-of-the-
 art image reconstruction quality in many applications. In this work\, we a
 im to further improve the computational efficacy of PnP methods by designi
 ng a new algorithm that makes use of stochastic variance-reduced gradients
  (SVRG)\, a nascent idea to accelerate runtime in stochastic optimization.
  Compared with existing PnP methods using batch gradients or stochastic gr
 adients\, the new algorithm\, called PnP-SVRG\, achieves comparable or bet
 ter accuracy of image reconstruction at a much faster computational speed.
  Extensive numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the benefits 
 of the proposed algorithm through the application of phase retrieval in co
 njunction with a wide variety of popular image denoisers.\n\nBio:\n\nVince
 nt Monardo is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering D
 epartment at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. Yuejie Chi. Vincent
  received his BSE with Honors in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State
  University with a Minor in Applied Mathematics. Vincent’s research inte
 rests lie in the domain of designing and analyzing efficient algorithms fo
 r solving inverse problems–especially within the realm of image reconstr
 uction–which improve upon the computational and statistical performance 
 of state-of-the-art methods. In the future\, Vincent is motivated to teach
  future generations the beauty of machine learning–in 2019\, he received
  the CMU ECE Outstanding Teaching Award. In his spare time\, Vincent enjoy
 s trivia\, crosswords\, music\, and rock climbing.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.
