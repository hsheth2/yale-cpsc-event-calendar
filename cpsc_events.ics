DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nMaria Pacheco\n\nHost: Marynel V
 ázquez\n\nTitle: Neural-Symbolic Modeling for Natural Language Discourse
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage “in the wild” is complex and ambiguous and r
 elies on a shared understanding of the world for its interpretation. Most 
 current NLP methods represent language by learning word co-occurrence patt
 erns from massive amounts of linguistic data. This representation can be v
 ery powerful\, but it is insufficient to capture the meaning behind writte
 n and spoken communication. In this talk\, I will motivate neural-symbolic
  representations for dealing with these challenges. On the one hand\, symb
 ols have inherent explanatory power\, and they can help us express domain 
 knowledge and enforce consistency across different decisions. On the other
  hand\, expressive distributed representations allow us to leverage the st
 rengths of statistical language models to make sense of large amounts of l
 inguistic data.\n\nIn this talk\, I will introduce a holistic framework th
 at covers all stages of the neural-symbolic pipeline: modeling\, learning\
 , inference\, and its application for analyzing discourse in real-world sc
 enarios and show its advantages with respect to end-to-end neural approach
 es and traditional statistical relational learning methods.\n\nBio\n:\n\nM

 urdue University. Her research focuses broadly on neural-symbolic methods
  to model natural language discourse scenarios\, such as analyzing convers
 ations\, argumentation\, and narratives. Before joining Purdue\, she spent

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\n\nArman\nCohan\n\nHost: Dragomir 
 Radev\n\nTitle: Beyond Sentences and Paragraphs: Towards Document and Mult
 i-document Understanding\n\nAbstract:\n\nDuring the past few years\, there
  has been significant progress in natural language understanding\, primari
 ly due to the advancements in transfer learning methods and the increasing
  scale of pre-trained language models. However\, the majority of progress 
 has been made on tasks concerning short texts with sentences or paragraphs
  as the basic unit of analysis. Yet\, many real-world natural language tas
 ks require understanding full documents which includes learning effective 
 representation of documents\, resolving longer range dependencies\, struct
 ure\, and argumentation. Further\, certain tasks require incorporating add
 itional context from multiple related documents (e.g.\, understanding a sc
 ientific paper) and aggregating information across multiple documents. In 
 this talk\, I will discuss some of our recent works on addressing these ch
 allenges. I will first discuss general methods for document representation
  learning that help to achieve strong downstream performance on a variety 
 of document-level tasks. Then I will focus on how we can have a general pr
 e-trained language model that can process long documents. Using this frame
 work\, I will discuss extensions to multi-document natural language unders
 tanding for a variety of classification\, extraction\, and summarization t
 asks. I will also briefly discuss a few of our newly developed benchmarks 
 from challenging domains that enable us to better measure progress on docu
 ment natural language understanding.\n\nBio:\n\nArman Cohan is a Research 
 Scientist at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and an Affiliate Assistant P
 rofessor at the University of Washington. His broad research interest is d
 eveloping natural language processing (NLP) methods for addressing informa
 tion overload. This includes models and benchmarks for document and multi-
 document understanding\, natural language generation and summarization\, a
 s well as information discovery and filtering. He is additionally interest
 ed in real-world interdisciplinary applications of NLP in the science and 
 health domains. His research has been recognized with multiple awards\, in
 cluding a best paper award at EMNLP 2017\, an honorable mention at COLING

 tle: Deep Learning for Embedding and Integrating Multimodal Biomedical Dat
 a\n\nAdvisor\n:\nSmita Krishnaswamy\n\nOther committee members:\n\nRonald 
 Coifman\nVladimir Rokhlin\n\nAbstract:\n\nBiomedical data is being generat
 ed in extremely high throughput and high dimension by technologies in area
 s ranging from single-cell genomics\, proteomics\, and transcriptomics (cy
 tometry\, single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing) to neuroscience and cogniti
 on (fMRI and PET) to pharmaceuticals (drug perturbations and interactions)
 . These new and emerging technologies and the datasets they create give an
  unprecedented view into the workings of their respective biological entit
 ies. However\, there is a large gap between the information contained in t
 hese datasets and the insights that current machine learning methods can e
 xtract from them.\n\nThis is especially the case when multiple technologie
 s can measure the same underlying biological entity or system. By separate
 ly analyzing the same system but from different views gathered by differen
 t data modalities\, patterns are left unobserved if they only emerge from 
 the multi-dimensional joint representation of all of the modalities togeth
 er. Through an interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes active collabora
 tion with data domain experts\, my research has developed models for \\tex
 tbf{data integration}\, extracting important insights through the joint an
 alysis of varied data sources.\n\nIn this thesis\, I discuss models that a
 ddress this task of multi-modal data integration\, especially generative a
 dversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs). My research has been fo
 cused on using both of these models in a generative way for concrete probl
 ems in cutting-edge scientific applications rather than the exclusive focu
 s on the generation of high-resolution natural images. The research in thi
 s thesis is united around ideas of building models that can extract new kn
 owledge from scientific data inaccessible to currently existing methods.\n

 Title: Automated Approaches for Program Verification and Repair\n\nAdviso
 r\n:\nRuzica Piskac\n\nOther committee members:\nZhong Shao\nAbhishek Bhat
 tacharjee\nNate Foster (Cornell University)\n\nAbstract:\n\nFormal methods
  techniques such as verification\, analysis\, and synthesis allow programm
 ers to prove properties of their programs\, or automatically derive progra
 ms from specifications. This dissertation presents automated analysis and 
 synthesis techniques to ease the debugging of modular verification systems
 \, allow easy access to constraint solvers from functional code\, and to r
 educe the burden of network administrators writing and analyzing firewalls
 .\n\nWe describe the design and implementation of a symbolic execution eng
 ine\, G2\, for non-strict functional languages such as Haskell. We then ex
 tended G2 to assist with modular verification. Modular verifiers allow pro
 grammers to write and prove specifications of their code. When a modular v
 erifier fails to verify a program\, it could be because of an actual bug i
 n the program\, but it could also be because a specification somewhere in 
 the program is too weak. We present a technique\, counterfactual symbolic 
 execution\, to aid in the debugging of both types of modular verification 
 failures\, by finding counterexample or counterexample-like explanations o
 f the failure. Further\, a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGI
 S) loop based technique is introduced to fully automate modular verificati
 on\, by using found counterexamples to automatically infer needed function
  specifications. The counterfactual symbolic execution and automated speci
 fication inference techniques are evaluated on existing LiquidHaskell erro
 rs and programs.\n\nIn addition to leveraging G2 to explain modular verifi
 cation errors\, we built a library\, G2Q\, which makes it easy for Haskell
  programmers to call G2 to solve constraint problem written in Haskell. G2
 Q uses symbolic execution to unroll recursive function definitions\, and g
 uarantees that the use of G2Q constraints will preserve type correctness.\
 n\nFinally\, we describe techniques to ease analysis and repair of firewal
 ls. Firewalls are widely deployed to manage network security. However\, fi
 rewall systems provide only a primitive interface\, in which the specifica
 tion is given as an ordered list of rules. This makes it hard to manually 
 track and maintain the behavior of a firewall. We introduce a formal seman
 tics for iptables firewall rules via a translation to first-order logic wi
 th uninterpreted functions and linear integer arithmetic\, which allows en
 coding of firewalls into a decidable logic. We then describe techniques to
  automate the analysis and repair of firewalls using SMT solvers\, based o
 n user provided specifications of the desired behavior. We evaluate this a
 pproach with real world case studies collected from StackOverflow users.\n

 son about the novel objects\, tasks\, and interactions inherent to everyda

 s by assuming they will inevitably encounter situations\nthat they are ini
 tially unprepared to address. My work enables a robot to address these nov
 el\nsituations by learning from a human teacher’s domain knowledge of th
 e task\, such as the\ncontextual use of an object or tool. Meeting this ch
 allenge requires robots to be flexible not only\nto novelty\, but to diffe

 and its various causes\, on\nthe robot’s learning goals\, (2) methods fo

 \nTitle: Learning 3D representations with minimal supervision\n\nAbstract:
 \n\nDeep learning has demonstrated considerable success embedding images a
 nd more general 2D representations into compact feature spaces for downstr
 eam tasks like recognition\, registration\, and generation. Learning on 3D
  data\, however\, is the missing piece needed for embodied agents to perce
 ive their surrounding environments. To bridge the gap between 3D perceptio
 n and robotic intelligence\, my present efforts focus on learning 3D repre
 sentations with minimal supervision.\n\nIn this talk\, I will discuss two 
 key aspects to reduce the amount of human supervision in current 3D deep l
 earning algorithms. First\, I will talk about how to recover structures fr
 om 3D data such as point clouds and incorporate such inductive bias into p
 oint cloud learning pipelines. Second\, I will present our works on levera

 s\n\nAbstract\n\nSystems that support expressive\, situated natural langua
 ge interactions are essential for expanding access to complex computing sy
 stems\, such as robots and databases\, to non-experts. Reasoning and learn
 ing in such natural language interactions is a challenging open problem. F
 or example\, resolving sentence meaning requires reasoning not only about 
 word meaning\, but also about the interaction context\, including the hist
 ory of the interaction and the situated environment. In addition\, the seq
 uential dynamics that arise between user and system in and across interact
 ions make learning from static data\, i.e.\, supervised data\, both challe
 nging and ineffective. However\, these same interaction dynamics result in
  ample opportunities for learning from implicit and explicit feedback that
  arises naturally in the interaction. This lays the foundation for systems
  that continually learn\, improve\, and adapt their language use through i
 nteraction\, without additional annotation effort. In this talk\, I will f
 ocus on these challenges and opportunities. First\, I will describe our wo
 rk on modeling dependencies between language meaning and interaction conte
 xt when mapping natural language in interaction to executable code. In the
  second part of the talk\, I will describe our work on language understand
 ing and generation in collaborative environments\, focusing on learning to
  recover from errors and on continual learning from explicit and implicit 
 user feedback.\n\nBio\n\nAlane Suhr is a PhD Candidate in the Department o

 n\nAbstract:\n\nLarge-scale deep learning models have become the foundatio
 n of today’s natural language processing (NLP). Despite their recent\, t
 remendous success\, they struggle with generalization in real-world settin
 gs\, like their predecessors. Besides\, their sheer scale brings new chall
 enges—the increasing computational cost heightens the barriers to entry 
 to NLP research.\n\nThe first part of the talk will discuss innovations in
  neural architectures that can help address the efficiency concerns of tod
 ay’s NLP. I will present algorithms that reduce state-of-the-art NLP mod
 els’ overhead from quadratic to linear in input lengths without hurting 
 accuracy. Second\, I will turn to inductive biases grounded in the inheren
 t structure of natural language sentences\, which can help machine learnin
 g models generalize. I will discuss the integration of discrete\, symbolic
  structure prediction into modern deep learning.\n\nI will conclude with f

 \n\nTitle: Machine learning for equitable healthcare\n\nAbstract:\n\nAdvan
 ces in machine learning and the explosion of clinical data have demonstrat
 ed immense potential to fundamentally improve clinical care and deepen our
  understanding of human health. However\, algorithms for medical intervent
 ions and scientific discovery in heterogeneous patient populations are par
 ticularly challenged by the complexities of healthcare data. Not only are 
 clinical data noisy\, missing\, and irregularly sampled\, but questions of
  equity and fairness also raise grave concerns and create additional compu
 tational challenges.\n\nIn this talk\, I present two approaches for levera
 ging machine learning towards equitable healthcare. First\, I demonstrate 
 how to adapt disease progression modeling to account for differences in ac
 cess to care. Using a deep generative model\, we can correct for patient m
 isalignment in disease onset time to learn more clinically useful disease 
 subtypes. Second\, I examine how to address algorithmic bias in supervised
  learning for cost-based metrics discimination. By decomposing discriminat
 ion into bias\, variance\, and noise components\, I propose tailored actio
 ns for estimating and reducing each term of the total dscimination. The ta
 lk concludes with a discussion about how to rethink the entire machine lea
 rning pipeline with an ethical lens to building algorithms that serve the 
 entire patient population.\n\nBio:\n\nIrene Chen is a PhD student in the C
 linical Machine Learning group at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial
