 Enhancing the Creative Process in Digital Prototyping\n\nAdvisor: Julie Do

 nDespite advances in computer-aided design (CAD) systems and video editing
  software\, digital content creation for design\, storytelling\, and inter
 active experiences remains a challenging problem. This dissertation introd
 uces a series of studies\, techniques\, and systems along three thrusts th
 at engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in author
 ing digital content.\n\nFirst\, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotem
 poral analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing trac
 ing\, freehand drawing\, and computer-generated approximations. We found a
  high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used o
 ver time\, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emula
 ting drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique fo
 r line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models\, where our learned style
  space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line draw
 ing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.\n\nS
 econd\, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the 
 creative process in augmented reality through two tablet-based interfaces.
  DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for r
 emote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes\, such as D
 ollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing 
 in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in th
 eir spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the poin
 t cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more
  accessible and versatile.\n\nLast\, we introduce two procedural methods t
 o generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. Ani
 Code supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animati
 ons in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates vi
 deo flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D da
 ta for cultural heritage. Our user studies show that these methods can ben
 efit the video-oriented digital prototyping experience and facilitate the 
 dissemination of creative and cultural ideas.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/e
