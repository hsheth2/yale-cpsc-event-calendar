DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk Hsin-Yuan (Robert) Huang\n\nThis w
 ill be a Zoom presentation with the option of viewing with others in AKW 2
 00.\n\nHost: Yongshan Ding\n\nTitle: Learning in the quantum universe\n\nA
 bstract:\n\nI will present recent progress in building a rigorous theory t
 o understand how scientists\, machines\, and future quantum computers coul
 d learn models of our quantum universe. The talk will begin with an exper
 imentally feasible procedure for converting a quantum many-body system int
 o a succinct classical description of the system\, its classical shadow. C
 lassical shadows can be applied to efficiently predict many properties of
  interest\, including expectation values of local observables and few-body
  correlation functions. I will then build on the classical shadow formali
 sm to answer two fundamental questions at the intersection of machine lear
 ning and quantum physics: Can classical machines learn to solve challengin
 g problems in quantum physics? And can quantum machines learn exponential
 ly faster than classical machines?\n\nBio:\n\nHsin-Yuan Huang (Robert) is 
 a Ph.D. student at Caltech\, advised by John Preskill and Thomas Vidick. H
 is research focuses on understanding how the theory of learning can provid
 e new insights into physics\, information\, and quantum computing. His no
 table works include classical shadow tomography for learning large-scale q
 uantum systems\, provably efficient machine learning algorithms for solvi
 ng quantum many-body problems\, and quantum advantages in learning from ex
 periments. He has been awarded a Google Ph.D. fellowship\, the Quantum Cr
 eator Prize\, MediaTek research young scholarship\, and the Kortschak scho
 larship.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-hsin-yuan-robert-huang
