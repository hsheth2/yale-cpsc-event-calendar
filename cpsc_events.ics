 ance-Reduced Gradient Methods\n\nAbstract:\n\nPlug-and-play (PnP) methods 
 have recently emerged as a powerful framework for image reconstruction tha
 t can flexibly combine different physics-based observation models with dat
 a-driven image priors in the form of denoisers\, and achieve state-of-the-
 art image reconstruction quality in many applications. In this work\, we a
 im to further improve the computational efficacy of PnP methods by designi
 ng a new algorithm that makes use of stochastic variance-reduced gradients
  (SVRG)\, a nascent idea to accelerate runtime in stochastic optimization.
  Compared with existing PnP methods using batch gradients or stochastic gr
 adients\, the new algorithm\, called PnP-SVRG\, achieves comparable or bet
 ter accuracy of image reconstruction at a much faster computational speed.
  Extensive numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the benefits 
 of the proposed algorithm through the application of phase retrieval in co
 njunction with a wide variety of popular image denoisers.\n\nBio:\n\nVince
 nt Monardo is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering D
 epartment at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. Yuejie Chi. Vincent
  received his BSE with Honors in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State
  University with a Minor in Applied Mathematics. Vincent’s research inte
 rests lie in the domain of designing and analyzing efficient algorithms fo
 r solving inverse problems–especially within the realm of image reconstr
 uction–which improve upon the computational and statistical performance 
 of state-of-the-art methods. In the future\, Vincent is motivated to teach
  future generations the beauty of machine learning–in 2019\, he received
  the CMU ECE Outstanding Teaching Award. In his spare time\, Vincent enjoy
 s trivia\, crosswords\, music\, and rock climbing.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.
