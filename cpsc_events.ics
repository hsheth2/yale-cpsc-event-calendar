 \n\nTitle: Machine learning for equitable healthcare\n\nAbstract:\n\nAdvan
 ces in machine learning and the explosion of clinical data have demonstrat
 ed immense potential to fundamentally improve clinical care and deepen our
  understanding of human health. However\, algorithms for medical intervent
 ions and scientific discovery in heterogeneous patient populations are par
 ticularly challenged by the complexities of healthcare data. Not only are 
 clinical data noisy\, missing\, and irregularly sampled\, but questions of
  equity and fairness also raise grave concerns and create additional compu
 tational challenges.\n\nIn this talk\, I present two approaches for levera
 ging machine learning towards equitable healthcare. First\, I demonstrate 
 how to adapt disease progression modeling to account for differences in ac
 cess to care. Using a deep generative model\, we can correct for patient m
 isalignment in disease onset time to learn more clinically useful disease 
 subtypes. Second\, I examine how to address algorithmic bias in supervised
  learning for cost-based metrics discimination. By decomposing discriminat
 ion into bias\, variance\, and noise components\, I propose tailored actio
 ns for estimating and reducing each term of the total dscimination. The ta
 lk concludes with a discussion about how to rethink the entire machine lea
 rning pipeline with an ethical lens to building algorithms that serve the 
 entire patient population.\n\nBio:\n\nIrene Chen is a PhD student in the C
 linical Machine Learning group at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial 
 Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)\, advised by David Sontag. Her work centers on ma
 chine learning methods for improving clinical care and making it more equi
 table\, as well as auditing and addressing bias in algorithmic models. Her
  work has been published in machine learning conferences (NeurIPS\, AAAI) 
 and medical journals (Nature Medicine\, Lancet Digital Health)\, and has b
 een covered by media outlets including MIT Tech Review\, NPR/WGBH\, and St
 at News. She has been named a Rising Star in EECS by University of Califor
 nia Berkeley\, Harvard\, and University of Maryland. Prior to her PhD\, Ir
 ene received her AB/SM from Harvard and worked at Dropbox.\n\nTalk flyer\n

 nTitle:  Theoretical Foundations of Pre-trained Models\n\nAbstract:\n\nA 
 pre-trained model refers to any model trained on broad data at scale and c
 an be adapted (e.g.\, fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks. The
  rise of pre-trained models (e.g.\, BERT\, GPT-3\, CLIP\, Codex\, MAE) tra
 nsforms applications in various domains and aligns with how humans learn. 
 Humans and animals first establish their concepts or impressions from diff
 erent data domains and data modalities. The learned concepts then help the
 m learn specific tasks with minimal external instructions. Accordingly\, w
 e argue that a pre-trained model follows a similar procedure through the l
 ens of deep representation learning. 1) Learn a data representation that f
 ilters out irrelevant information from the training tasks\; 2) Transfer th
 e data representation to downstream tasks with few labeled samples and sim
 ple models.\n\nThis talk establishes some theoretical understanding for pr
 e-trained models under different settings\, ranging from supervised pretra
 ining\, meta-learning\, and self-supervised learning to domain adaptation 
 or domain generalization. I will discuss the sufficient (and sometimes nec
 essary) conditions for pre-trained models to work based on the statistical
  relation between training and downstream tasks. The theoretical analyses 
 partly answer how they work\, when they fail\, guide technical decisions f
 or future work\, and inspire new methods in pre-trained models.\n\nBio:\n\

 ion\n\nAbstract:\n\nThere is no doubt that robots will play a crucial role
  in the future and need to work as a team in increasingly more complex app
 lications. Advances in robotics have laid the hardware foundations for bui
 lding large-scale multi-robot systems\, such as for mobile robots and dron
 es. But how to coordinate robots intelligently is a difficult problem: Exa
 ct methods\, such as integer programming and A*\, do not scale as the join
 t-state space increases exponentially with the number of robots\, while he
 uristic methods\, such as reactive methods and end-to-end learning\, may l
 ead to deadlocks or traffic congestion.\n\nIn this talk\, I will introduce
  intelligent planning algorithms for solving this challenge with a focus o
 n one fundamental problem: letting a large team of agents navigate without
  collisions in congested environments while minimizing their travel times.
  I will present principled planning algorithms that can efficiently coordi
 nate hundreds of agents while providing rigorous guarantees on completenes
 s and even optimality. I will also present techniques to apply these algor
 ithms to real-world problems with robustness guarantees\, such as warehous
 e robot coordination\, multi-robot motion planning\, railway planning\, an
 d airport surface operation.\n\nBio:\n\nJiaoyang Li is a Ph.D. candidate i

  data poses multiple hard challenges that break conventional machine learn
 ing assumptions. In this talk\, I will highlight the need to move beyond o
 ur prevalent machine learning paradigms and methods to enable them to driv
 e novel biomedical discoveries. I will give an overview of my work on deve
 loping open-world deep learning methods that generalize to scenarios never

  then describe the paradigm and methods needed to discover novel phenomena
 . I will discuss the biological findings enabled by my methods and the con
 ceptual shift they bring in annotating comprehensive single-cell atlas dat
 asets. Altogether\, my work demonstrates that generalization to never-befo

 tainty Quantification\n\nAbstract:\n\nMachine learning models are increasi
 ngly being incorporated into real-world systems\, targeting domains such a
 s robotics\, healthcare\, and software systems. A key challenge is ensurin
 g that such systems are trustworthy. I will describe a novel strategy for 
 composing machine learning models while providing provable correctness gua
 rantees. First\, we show how to quantify the uncertainty of any given mode
 l in a way that satisfies PAC correctness guarantees. Second\, we show how
  to compose guarantees for individual models to obtain a guarantee for the
  overall system. Then\, I will discuss applications to ensuring safety in 
 reinforcement learning from visual inputs\, and to speeding up inference t

 eural Graph Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing Tasks\n\nAdvi
 sor: Dragomir Radev\n\nOther committee members:\nMarynel Vázquez\nYang Ca
 i\nElisa Celis\n\nAbstract:\n\nNatural language is essential in our daily 
 lives as we rely on languages to communicate and exchange information. A f
 undamental goal for natural language processing (NLP) is to let the machin
 e understand natural language to help or replace human experts to mine kno
 wledge and complete tasks.\n\nMany NLP tasks deal with sequential data. Fo
 r example\, a sentence is considered as a sequence of works. However\, not
  all tasks can be formulated using sequence models. Specifically\, graph-s
 tructured data is also fundamental in NLP\, including entity linking\, ent
 ity classification\, relation extraction\, abstractive meaning representat
 ion\, and knowledge graphs. In this scenario\,  BERT-based pretrained mod
 els may not be suitable. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is a dee
 p neural network model designed for graphs. It has shown great potential i
 n text classification\, link prediction\, question answering and so on.\n\
 nThis dissertation presents novel graph models for NLP tasks\, including t
 ext classification\, prerequisite chain learning\, and coreference resolut
 ion. We focus on different perspectives of graph convolutional network mod
 eling: for text classification\, a novel graph construction method is prop
 osed which allows interpretability for the prediction\; for prerequisite c
 hain learning\, we propose multiple aggregation functions that utilize nei
 ghbors for better information exchange\; for coreference resolution\, we s
 tudy how graph pretraining can help when labeled data is limited. Moreover
 \, an important branch is to apply pretrained language models for the ment
 ioned tasks. So\, this dissertation also focuses on the transfer learning 
 method that generalizes pretrained models to other domains\, including med
 ical\, cross-lingual\, and web data. Finally\, we propose a new task calle
 d unsupervised cross-domain prerequisite chain learning\, and study novel 
 graph-based methods to transfer knowledge over graphs.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.y

 .\n\nThis talk will cover various scenarios where the resources used by an

 is and Program Synthesis for Learning\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the advancement
  of modern technologies\, programming becomes ubiquitous not only among pr
 ofessional software developers\, but also for general computer users. Howe
 ver\, gaining programming expertise is time-consuming and challenging. The
 refore\, program synthesis has many applications\, where the computer auto
 matically synthesizes programs from specifications such as natural languag
 e descriptions and input-output examples. In this talk\, I will present my
  work on learning-based program synthesis\, where I have developed deep le
 arning techniques for various program synthesis problems. Despite the rema
 rkable success of deep neural networks for many domains\, including natura
 l language processing and computer vision\, existing deep neural networks 
 are still insufficient for handling challenging symbolic reasoning and gen
 eralization problems.\n\nMy learning-based program synthesis research lies
  in two folds: (1) learning to synthesize programs from potentially ambigu
 ous and complex specifications\; and (2) neural-symbolic learning for lang
 uage understanding. I will first talk about program synthesis applications
 \, where my work demonstrates the applicability of learning-based program 
 synthesizers for production usage. I will then present my work on neural-s
 ymbolic frameworks that integrate symbolic components into neural networks
 \, which achieve better reasoning and generalization capabilities. In clos

  the complexity and generalizability of learning-based program synthesis f

 \nTitle: Learning 3D representations with minimal supervision\n\nAbstract:
 \n\nDeep learning has demonstrated considerable success embedding images a
 nd more general 2D representations into compact feature spaces for downstr
 eam tasks like recognition\, registration\, and generation. Learning on 3D
  data\, however\, is the missing piece needed for embodied agents to perce
 ive their surrounding environments. To bridge the gap between 3D perceptio
 n and robotic intelligence\, my present efforts focus on learning 3D repre
 sentations with minimal supervision.\n\nIn this talk\, I will discuss two 
 key aspects to reduce the amount of human supervision in current 3D deep l
 earning algorithms. First\, I will talk about how to recover structures fr
 om 3D data such as point clouds and incorporate such inductive bias into p
 oint cloud learning pipelines. Second\, I will present our works on levera
 ging natural supervision in point clouds to perform self-supervised learni
 ng. In addition\, I will discuss how these 3D learning algorithms enable h
 uman-level perception for robotic applications such as self-driving cars.
   Finally\, the talk will conclude with a discussion about future inquiri
 es to design complete and active 3D learning systems.\n\nBio:\n\nYue Wang
