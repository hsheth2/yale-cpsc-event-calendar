DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nIshan Agarwal\n\nHost: Holly Rush
 meier\n\nTitle: An Introduction to Recursion\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecursion is 
 a powerful idea which shows up not only in computer science\, but also i
 n other fields. It forms the basis of many interesting structures and pro
 blem solving approaches\, a few of which we will see in this talk. We will
  look at how recursion can be used to define functions\, mathematical obje
 cts and data structures\, as well as how it can be a powerful problem solv
 ing tool\; often allowing us to come up with clear and intelligible soluti
 ons to problems that are otherwise hard to attack. You can also expect 
 to see some other fun instances of recursion\, which might surprise you!\
 n\nBio:\n\nI’m Ishan Agarwal\, a final year PhD student at NYU. I have a
  broad interest in theoretical computer science. The areas I have explored
  so far include various topics in algorithmic game theory (my thesis work
  is on stable matchings and more generally matching markets)\, metric geom
 etry (low distortion lattice embeddings) and computational geometry (color
 ings of point sets in the plane). Currently I am working on novel variatio
 ns of the online matching problem.\n\nPerhaps even more so than research\,
  I am very passionate about teaching. I have had the good fortune to have 
 several rewarding teaching experiences at NYU and I am aiming to make the 
 focus of my career going forward.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk
