DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJoohyung Kim\, University o
 f Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n\nHost: Marynel Vazquez\n\nTitle: Towards Hum
 an-Friendly Robots\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe demand for robots which can work cl
 osely and interact physically with human has been growing. Such robots can
  already be found guiding\, serving\, and entertaining people in some plac
 es\, such as airports\, restaurants\, and amusement parks. However\, despi
 te advances in related technologies\, there are very few robotic applicati
 ons to meet the publicâ€™s expectations. To make robots help humans in dai
 ly life\, we need better understanding of human evironments and tasks\, be
 tter methods to perform the tasks through robots\, and better design to in
 teract with human naturally and safely. In this talk\, I will present my w
 orks and experience to make human-friendly robots by means of robot design
 \, motion control\, and human-robot interaction.\n\nBio:\n\nJoohyung Kim i
 s currently an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering 
 in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on des
 ign and control for humanoid robots\, system for motion learning in robot 
 hardware\, and safe human-robot interaction. He received BSE and Ph.D. deg
 rees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Seoul Nati
 onal University\, Korea\, in 2001 and 2012. He was with Disney Research as
  a Research Scientist from 2013 to 2019. Prior to joining Disney\, he was 
 a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon Univers
 ity for DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2013. From 2009 to 2012\, he was a Res
 earch Staff Member in Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\, Korea\, d
 eveloping biped walking controllers for humanoid robots.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc
