 ng\n\nTitle: Automated Discovery of Machine Learning Optimizations\n\nAbst
 ract:\n\nAs an increasingly important workload\, machine learning (ML) app
 lications require different performance optimization techniques from tradi
 tional runtimes and compilers. In particular\, to accelerate ML applicatio
 ns\, it is generally necessary to perform ML computations on heterogeneous
  hardware and parallelize computations using multiple data dimensions\, ne
 ither of which is even expressible in traditional compilers and runtimes. 
 In this talk\, I will describe my work on automated discovery of performan
 ce optimizations to accelerate ML computations.\n\nTASO\, the Tensor Algeb
 ra SuperOptimizer\, optimizes the computation graphs of deep neural networ
 ks (DNNs) by automatically generating potential graph optimizations and fo
 rmally verifying their correctness. TASO outperforms rule-based graph opti
 mizers in existing ML systems (e.g.\, TensorFlow\, TensorRT\, and TVM) by 
 up to 3x by automatically discovering novel graph optimizations\, while al
 so requiring significantly less human effort.\n\nFlexFlow is a system for 
 accelerating distributed DNN training. FlexFlow identifies parallelization
  dimensions not considered in existing ML systems (e.g.\, TensorFlow and P
 yTorch) and automatically discovers fast parallelization strategies for a 
 specific parallel machine. Companies and national labs are using FlexFlow 
 to train production ML models that do not scale well in current ML systems
 \, achieving over 10x performance improvement.\n\nI will also outline futu
 re research directions for further automating ML systems\, such as codesig
 ning ML models\, software systems\, and hardware backends for end-to-end M
 L deployment.\n\nBio:\n\nZhihao Jia is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer S
 cience department at Stanford University working with Alex Aiken and Matei
  Zaharia. His research interests lie in the intersection of computer syste
 ms and machine learning\, with a focus on building efficient\, scalable\, 
 and high-performance systems for ML computations.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.e

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAshia Wilson\n\nHost: Holly
  Rushmeier\n\nTitle: Variational Perspectives on Machine Learning: Algorit
 hms\, Inference\, and Fairness\n\nAbstract:\n\nMachine learning plays a ke
 y role in shaping the decisions made by a growing number of institutions. 
 This talk will share variational perspectives on aspects of inference\, al
 gorithms and fairness. On the topic of algorithms\, I will present a varia
 tional framework on a classical family of convex optimization algorithm ca
 lled accelerated gradient algorithms and demonstrate how it leads to simpl
 er\, faster gradient-based algorithms and generalizations of existing acce
 leration frameworks. On the topic of inference\, I will present a variatio
 nal framework for developing computationally efficient approximations of c
 ross-validation and show how it provides fast and reliable estimates of ou
 t-of-sample performance for many machine learning models. On the topic of 
 fairness\, I will present a variational model for reasoning about the long
 -term impacts of using machine learning models to allocate scarce resource
 s and opportunities to people\, such as employment and educational decisio
 ns.\n\nBio:\n\nAshia Wilson is a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine Le
 arning Group at Microsoft Research\, New England. She received undergradua
 te degrees in Applied Mathematics and Philosophy from Harvard University i
 n 2011. She received her doctorate in Statistics from the University of Ca
 lifornia\, Berkeley in 2018 advised by Benjamin Recht and Michael I. Jorda
 n. Her research interests are in providing rigorous guarantees for algorit
 hmic performance\, and in developing frameworks for studying issues of fai
 rness and governance in machine learning.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/eve

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJesse Thomason\n\nHost: Dra

 age to refer to objects like “toast”\, “plate”\, and “table” a
 nd to communicate requests such as “Could you make breakfast?” In this
  talk\, I will present work on computational methods to tie language to ph
 ysical\, grounded meaning. Robots are an ideal platform for such work beca
 use they can perceive and interact with the world. I will discuss dialog a
 nd learning strategies I have developed to enable robots to learn from the
 ir human partners\, similar to how people learn from one another through i
 nteraction. I will present methods enabling robots to understand language 
 referring expressions like “the heavy\, metallic mug”\, the first work
  showing that it is possible to learn to connect words to their perceptual
  properties in the visual\, tactile\, and auditory senses of a physical ro
 bot. I will also present benchmarks and models for translating high-level 
 human language like “put the toast on the table” that imply latent\, i
 ntermediate goals into executable sequences of agent actions with the help
  of low-level\, step-by-step language instructions. Finally\, I will discu
 ss how my work in grounded language contributes to NLP\, robotics\, and th
 e broader goals of the AI community.\n\nBio:\n\nJesse Thomason is a postdo
 ctoral researcher at the University of Washington working with Luke Zettle
 moyer. He received his PhD from the University of Texas at Austin with Ray
 mond Mooney. His research focuses on language grounding and natural langua
 ge processing applications for robotics (RoboNLP). Key to this work is usi
 ng dialog with humans to facilitate both robot task execution and learning
  to enable lifelong improvement of robots’ language understanding capabi
 lities. He has worked to encourage and promote work in RoboNLP through wor
 kshop organization at both NLP and robotics conference venues.\n\n\nhttps:

 ystems\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed software systems have become the backbo
 ne of Internet services. Consequently\, Failures in production distributed
  systems have severe consequences. A 63-minute outage of Amazon in 2018 ca
 used a 100-million loss in revenue. Moreover\, the frequency of failures r
 ises with the increasing complexity of software systems. 2019 has experien
 ced noticeably more Internet outages and is sometimes considered as the 
 “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failures in distributed systems 
 at data center scale is a particularly critical\, yet notoriously difficul
 t task because these systems are complex: there are numerous threads\, pro
 cesses\, and nodes communicating concurrently. Existing diagnosis techniqu
 es are either intrusive and incur non-negligible performance overhead in a
  production environment\, or face scalability challenges when applied to c
 omplex software systems.\n\nA promising approach is to replicate how devel
 opers diagnose these failures. Guided by this notion\, this talk will desc
 ribe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, which automate two major tas
 ks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction and root cause localization.
  Given the logs and code of a distributed system that has failed (in produ
 ction)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a minimal set of operations ne
 cessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux can further pinpoint the sin
 gle instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\n\nYongle Zhang is a PhD c
 andidate in the Distributed Systems Research Group at the University of To
 ronto\, working with Prof. Ding Yuan. His research interest is in systems 
 software with a focus on improving the reliability and availability of com
 plex\, real-world systems.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloqu

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nMing Liu\n\nHost: Anurag Kh
 andelwal\n\nTitle: Building Distributed Systems Using Programmable Network
 s\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of data center network bandwidth
 \, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU performance\, has challenged o
 ur conventional wisdom regarding data center networks: how to build distri
 buted systems that can keep up with the network speeds and are high-perfor
 mant and energy-efficient? The recent emergence of a programmable network 
 fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By offloading suitable computa
 tions to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, reconfigurable switch\, or networ
 k accelerator)\, one can reduce request serving latency\, save end-host CP
 U cores\, and enable efficient traffic control.\n\nIn this talk\, I will p
 resent two frameworks for building PNF-enabled distributed systems: (1) In
 cBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built with network accelerators and
  programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-based framework for offloadi
 ng distributed applications on SmartNICs. I will show how to make efficien
 t use of in-network heterogeneous computing resources by applying approxim
 ation techniques\, co-designing with end-host software layers\, employing 
 new programming abstractions\, and designing efficient control-/data-plane
 s. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to re-architect other data cent
 er systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Paul G. Allen 
 School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington\,
  advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy\, Luis Ceze\, and Simon Peter. His resear
 ch interests are in computer systems and networks\, with a focus on optimi
 zing distributed systems by exploring the computing capabilities across th
 e programmable network fabric (including SmartNICs\, reconfigurable switch
 es\, and network accelerators).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloq
