DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nAram-Alexandre Pooladian\n\nHost:
  Andre Wibisono\n\nTitle: Entropic estimation of optimal transport maps\n
 \nAbstract:\n\nWe develop a computationally tractable method for estimatin
 g the optimal mapbetween two distributions over R^d with rigorous finite
 -sample guarantees. Leveraging an entropic version of Brenier’s theorem
 \, we show that our estimator is easy to compute using Sinkhorn’s algor
 ithm. As a result\, unlike current approaches for map estimation\, which 
 are slow to evaluate when the dimension or number of samples is large\, o
 ur approach is parallelizable and extremely efficient even for massive da
 ta sets. Under smoothness assumptions on the optimal map\, we show that o
 ur estimator enjoys comparable statistical performance to other estimator
 s in the literature\, but with much lower computational cost. This is join
 t work with Jonathan Niles-Weed.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS/YQI Colloquium - Xiaodi Wu\, University
  of Maryland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Toward Applications and Toolchains of
  Analog Quantum Computing\n\nAbstract:\n\nAnalog computing predates digita
 l computing and remains a compelling computational paradigm for several do
 main applications in the post-Moore era.  A similar story has been observ
 ed in quantum computing where analog (or pulse-controllable) quantum devic
 es likely offer much more computing power than circuit-based digital quant
 um machines\, especially in the near term. However\, some paradigm change 
 is necessary before we can fully leverage analog quantum computing\, as mo
 st quantum applications and toolchains nowadays are designed with the mind
 set of digital quantum computing.\n\nIn this talk\, I will present two pro
 jects toward this paradigm change. First\, we present quantum Hamiltonian 
 descent (QHD)\, a proposal of a truly quantum counterpart of classical gra
 dient methods for continuous optimization. QHD is derived by a path integr
 al quantization of certain dynamical systems governed by classical physics
 \, which are shown recently as the continuous-time limit of classical grad
 ient methods. We develop an analog implementation of the resultant QHD alg
 orithm and empirically observe QHD’s performance on randomly generated n
 on-convex quadratic programming instances up to 75 dimensions\, which sign
 ificantly outperforms a selection of state-of-the-art classical solvers an
 d the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Second\, we present a domain-specific l
 anguage for quantum simulation\, called SIMUQ\, which supports a direct co
 mpilation from the description of Hamiltonian evolution to the pulse-level
  schedule of heterogeneous analog quantum simulators.\n\nhttps://quantumin
