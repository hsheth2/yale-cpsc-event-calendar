DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS/YQI Colloquium\nJakub Szefer\, Yale Uni
 versity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Computer Cybersecurity\n\nAs Quantu
 m Computer device research continues to advance rapidly\, there are also a
 dvances at the other levels of the computer system stack that involve thes
 e devices. In particular\, more and more of the Quantum Computer devices a
 re becoming available as cloud-based services through IBM Quantum\, Amazon
  Braket\, Microsoft Azure\, and others. In parallel\, researchers have put
  forward ideas about multi-programming of the Quantum Computer devices whe
 re single device can be shared by multiple programs\, or even multiple use
 rs. While all of the advances make the Quantum Computer devices more easil
 y accessible and increase utilization\, they open up the devices to variou
 s security threats. Especially\, with cloud-based access and multi-tenancy
 \, different\, remove\, and untrusted users could abuse the Quantum Comput
 er devices to leak information from other users using the shared devices\,
  map or learn about the Quantum Computer infrastructure itself\, or even p
 ossibly try to damage the infrastructure or the devices. This talk will ai
 m to provide some background on security lessons that Computer Architectur
 e and Hardware Security community has learned from the past decades explor
 ing hardware-related security issues in classical computers. It will then 
 motivate the need to think about Quantum Computer cybersecurity now\, to m
 ake sure that security is first-class objective when designing and deployi
 ng these devices in cloud-based settings. The talk will then present recen
 t research on security attacks on Quantum Computer devices in IBM Quantum 
 cloud-based computers\, as well as preliminary developments of defensive t
 echniques. The end goal of the presentation is to motivate discussion abou
 t Quantum Computer Cybersecurity and make connections between the Quantum 
 Computer research community and the Hardware Security research community.\

SUMMARY:Dissertation Defense - Zeyu Wang

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nZeyu Wang\n\nTitle: 
 Enhancing the Creative Process in Digital Prototyping\n\nAdvisor: Julie Do
 rsey\n\nOther Committee Members:\nHolly Rushmeier\nSteven Zucker\nLeonard 
 McMillan (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nDespite advances in computer-aided design (CAD) systems and video editing
  software\, digital content creation for design\, storytelling\, and inter
 active experiences remains a challenging problem. This dissertation introd
 uces a series of studies\, techniques\, and systems along three thrusts th
 at engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in author
 ing digital content.\n\nFirst\, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotem
 poral analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing trac
 ing\, freehand drawing\, and computer-generated approximations. We found a
  high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used o
 ver time\, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emula
 ting drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique fo
 r line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models\, where our learned style
  space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line draw
 ing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.\n\nS
 econd\, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the 
 creative process in augmented reality through two tablet-based interfaces.
  DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for r
 emote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes\, such as D
 ollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing 
 in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in th
 eir spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the poin
 t cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more
  accessible and versatile.\n\nLast\, we introduce two procedural methods t
 o generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. Ani
 Code supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animati
 ons in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates vi
 deo flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D da
 ta for cultural heritage. Our user studies show that these methods can ben
 efit the video-oriented digital prototyping experience and facilitate the 
 dissemination of creative and cultural ideas.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/e

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJason Weston\, Facebook AI
  & NYU Visiting Research Professor\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nTitle: A jou
 rney from ML and NNs to NLP and Beyond: Just more of the same isn’t enou
 gh?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe first half of the talk will look back on the las
 t two decades of machine learning\, neural network and natural language pr
 ocessing research for dialogue\, through my personal lens\, to discuss the
  advances that have been made and the circumstances in which they happened
  – to try to give clues of what we should be working on for the future. 
 The second half will dive deeper into some current first steps in those fu
 ture directions\, in particular trying to fix the problems of neural gener
 ative models to enable deeper reasoning with short and long-term coherence
 \, and to ground such dialogue agents to an environment where they can act
  and learn. We will argue that just scaling up current techniques\, while 
 a worthy investigation\, will not be enough to solve these problems.\n\n\n
