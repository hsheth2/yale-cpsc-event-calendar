 nAbstract:\n\nGiven a specification F(X\,Y) over the set of input variable
 s X and output variables Y\, we want the assistant\, aka functional synthe
 sis engine\, to design a function G such that (X\,Y=G(X)) satisfies F. Fun
 ctional synthesis has been studied for over 150 years\, dating back Boole 
 in 1850’s and yet scalability remains a core challenge. Motivated by pro
 gress in machine learning\, we design a new algorithmic framework Manthan\
 , which views functional synthesis as a classification problem\, relying o
 n advances in constrained sampling for data generation\, and advances in a
 utomated reasoning for novel proof-guided refinement and provable verifica
 tion. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation of 609 benchmarks\, we demon
 strate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the a
 rt\, solving 509 benchmarks in comparison to 280\, which is the most solve
 d by a state-of-the-art technique. The significant performance improvement
 s\, along with our detailed analysis\, highlight several exciting avenues 
 of future work in machine learning\, constrained sampling\, and automated 
 reasoning.\n\nBio:\n\nPriyanka\n\nGolia\nis a Ph.D. candidate at National 
 University of Singapore and Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur\, India.
  Her research interests lie in the area of automated reasoning and formal 
 methods. Specifically\, her work is directed at functional synthesis\, con
 strained sampling\, and knowledge compilation.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/

 h\n\nHost: Dan Spielman\n\nAn Almost-Linear Time Algorithm for Maximum Flo
 w and More\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk\, I will explain a new algorithm f
 or computing exact maximum and minimum-cost flows in almost-linear time\, 
 settling the time complexity of these basic graph problems up to subpolyno
 mial factors.\n\nOur algorithm uses a novel interior point method that bui
 lds the optimal flow as a sequence of approximate minimum-ratio cycles\, e
 ach of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynami
 c data structure.\n\nBy well-known reductions\, our result implies almost-
 linear time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching\,
  optimal transport\, and undirected vertex connectivity. Our framework als
 o extends to minimizing general edge-separable convex functions to high ac
 curacy\, yielding the first almost-linear time algorithms for many other p
 roblems including entropy-regularized optimal transport\, matrix scaling\,
  p-norm flows\, and isotonic regression.\n\nThis talk is based on joint wo
 rk with Li Chen\, Yang P. Liu\, Richard Peng\, Maximilian Probst Gutenberg
 \, and Sushant Sachdeva. Our result appeared in FOCS’22 and won the FOCS
  best paper award.\n\nBio:\n\nRasmus Kyng is an assistant professor of the
 oretical computer science at ETH Zurich. Before joining the department in 
 2019\, he was a postdoctoral fellow and Harvard SEAS and the Simons Instit
 ute at UC Berkeley. In 2017\, he received a PhD in computer science from Y
 ale University\, where he was advised by Daniel Spielman.\n\nHis work focu
 ses on fast algorithms for solving graph problems\, convex optimization\, 
 and structured linear equations. In addition\, he develops hardness result
 s for basic algorithmic problems and probability theoretic tools for algor
 ithmic applications. His research has won the FOCS’22 best paper and FOC
 S’17 best student paper awards.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n\n\nCS Colloquium\nSiddharth Srivastava\, 
 Arizona State University\n\nHost: Tesca Fitzgerald\n\nTitle: From Sample-E
 fficiency to User-Driven AI Assessment:\nLearning Generalizable Knowledge 
 for Reliable Sequential Decision Making\n\nAbstract:\n\nI will present rec
 ent advances on learning for a range of sequential decision-making problem
 s\, from generalizable planning and learning for long-horizon tasks in det
 erministic and stochastic environments to enabling end-users to assess the
  limits and capabilities of their AI systems\, even as these systems adapt
  and learn. In the first part of the talk I will focus on neuro-symbolic a
 bstractions for robot planning and our recent work on learning such abstr
 actions from scratch. These methods facilitate generalizable learning that
  can be transferred to much larger problems and they outperform existing a
 pproaches on tasks that were not seen during training. In the second part 
 of the talk\, I will discuss research challenges and solution approaches f
 or a new\, emerging problem: while we expect AI systems to continually ada
 pt and learn\, the problem of enabling end-users to safely determine the l
 imits and capabilities of their changing AI systems remains largely unaddr
 essed. I will conclude with some of our recent results on user-driven asse
 ssment of adaptive black-box AI systems.\n\nBio:\n\nSiddharth Srivastava i
 s an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computing an
 d Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. Before joining ASU\,
  Siddharth was a Staff Scientist at the United Technologies Research Cente
 r in Berkeley. Prior to that\, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the RUG
 S group at the University of California Berkeley. Siddharth received his P
 hD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His r
 esearch interests include robotics and AI\, with a focus on reasoning\, pl
 anning\, and acting under uncertainty. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER
  award\, a Best Paper award at the International Conference on Automated P
 lanning and Scheduling (ICAPS) and an Outstanding Dissertation award from 
 the Department of Computer Science at UMass Amherst. He served as conferen
 ce chair for ICAPS 2019 and currently serves as an Associate Editor for th
 e Journal of AI Research.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloqui
