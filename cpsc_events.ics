DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nKaterina Sotiraki\n\nHost: Charal
 ampos Papamanthou\n\nTitle: Towards post-quantum cryptography\n\nAbstract:
 \n\nThe advent of quantum computers places many widely used cryptographic 
 protocols at risk.Â  In response to this threat\, the field of post-quantu
 m cryptography has emerged. The most broadly recognized post-quantum proto
 cols are related to lattices. Beyond their resistance to quantum attacks\,
  lattices are instrumental tools in cryptography due to their rich mathema
 tical structure. In this talk\, I will present my work on understanding th
 e complexity of lattice problems and on constructing lattice-based cryptog
 raphic protocols useful in practical scenarios. First\, I will present an 
 optimal construction for worst-case collision-resistant hash functions bas
 ed on a lattice problem. Second\, I will show the first lattice-based cons
 truction of cryptographic proofs with minimal communication and zero-knowl
 edge for any language in NP.\n\nBio:\n\nKaterina Sotiraki is currently a p
 ost-doctoral researcher at the EECS Department of UC Berkeley working with
  Alessandro Chiesa and Raluca Ada Popa. She received her PhD from the EECS
  Department at MIT where she was advised by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. She work
 s on cryptography\, complexity theory\, and secure computation\, with focu
 s on cryptography based on lattices.\n\nTalk Flyer\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.
