 ker\n\nTitle: Learning Systems in Adaptive Environments. Theory\, Algorith
 ms and Design\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecent years have seen great successes in th
 e development of learning algorithms in static predictive and generative t
 asks\, where the objective is to learn a model that performs well on a sin
 gle test deployment and in applications with abundant data. Comparatively 
 less success has been achieved in designing algorithms for deployment in a
 daptive scenarios where the data distribution may be influenced by the cho
 ices of the algorithm itself\, the algorithm needs to adaptively learn fro
 m human feedback\, or the nature of the environment is rapidly changing. T
 hese are some of the most important challenges in the development of ML dr
 iven solutions for technologies such as interactive web systems\, ML drive
 n scientific experimentation\, and robotics. To fully realize the potentia
 l of these technologies we will necessitate better ways of identifying pro
 blem domains and designing algorithms for adaptive learning.\n\nTo achieve
  this\, in this talk I propose adopting a systems view of adaptive learni
 ng mechanisms along with the following algorithm design considerations 1) 
 development of sample efficient and tractable algorithms\, 2) generalizati
 on to unseen domains via effective knowledge transfer and 3) human centric
  decision making. I will give an overview of my work along each of these a
 xes and introduce a variety of open problems and research directions inspi
 red by this conceptual framing.\n\nBio:\n\nAldo is a Postdoctoral Research
 er at Microsoft Research NYC. He obtained his PhD at UC Berkeley where he 
 was advised by Peter Bartlett and Michael Jordan. His research lies in the
  areas of Reinforcement Learning\, Online Learning\, Bandits and Algorithm
 ic Fairness. He is particularly interested in furthering our statistical u
 nderstanding of learning phenomena in adaptive environments and use these 
 theoretical insights and techniques to design efficient and safe algorithm
 s for scientific\, engineering\, and large-scale societal applications.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nHost: Ruzica Piskac\n\nTitle: Towards Crea
 ting Correct Numerics\n\nAbstract:\n\nNumeric application is an integral p
 art of computer science. Real number computations are becoming increasingl
 y important with the rapid development of machine learning\, high-performa
 nce computing\, and simulations. However\, accurate and efficient numerica
 l computations are still open research areas. A problem as simple as effic
 iently and correctly approximating elementary functions is still challengi
 ng and mainstream math libraries do not produce correct results.\n\nThis t
 alk presents several challenges in numerical computation and proposes the 
 RLibm project. This project builds efficient correctly rounded elementary 
 functions for multiple representations. It makes a case for approximating 
 the correctly rounded results of an elementary function rather than the re
 al value of an elementary function. The talk then explores how this approa
 ch can be applied broadly and discuss future directions to take another st
 ep toward correct numerics.\n\nBio:\n\nJay Lim is a Lecturer at Yale Uni
 versity. He received his PhD at Rutgers University under Santosh Nagarakat
 te. His research interest lies in making all low-level systems correct and
  secure. These systems include but are not limited to compilers\, cryptog
 raphic algorithms\, standard libraries\, numerical applications\, and ML. 
 His dream is to see the day that all systems are free of bugs.\n\n\n\n\nht
