DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nFraser Brown\n\nTitle: Elim
 inating bugs in real systems\n\nHost: Holly Rushmeier\n\nAbstract:\n\nSoft
 ware is everywhere\, and almost everywhere\, software is broken. Some bugs
  just crash your printer\; others hand an identity thief your bank account
  number\; still others let nation-states spy on dissidents and persecute m
 inorities.\n\nThis talk outlines my work preventing bugs using a blend of 
 programming languages techniques and systems design. First\, I’ll talk a
 bout securing massive\, security-critical codebases without clean slate re
 writes. This means rooting out hard-to-find bugs—as in Sys\, which scale
 s symbolic execution to find exploitable bugs in systems like the twenty-m
 illion line Chrome browser. It also means proving correctness of especiall
 y vulnerable pieces of code—as in VeRA\, which automatically verifies pa
 rt of the Firefox JavaScript engine. Finally\, I’ll discuss work on stro
 nger foundations for new systems—as in CirC\, a recent project unifying 
 compiler infrastructure for program verification\, cryptographic proofs\, 
 optimization problems\, and more.\n\nBio:\n\nFraser Brown is a PhD student
  at Stanford advised by Dawson Engler\, occasional visiting student at UCS
 D with Deian Stefan\, and NSF graduate research fellowship recipient. She 
 works at the intersection of programming languages\, systems\, and securit
 y\, and her research has been used by several companies. She holds an unde
 rgraduate degree in English from Stanford.\n\n*Contact\nAlicia\nor\nNancy\

  Learning through Interaction in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems\n\nHost: 
 Marynel Vázquez\n\nAbstract:\n\nEffective communication is an important s
 kill for enabling information exchange and cooperation in multi-agent syst
 ems\, in which agents coexist in shared environments with humans and/or ot
 her artificial agents.  Indeed\, human domain experts can be a highly inf
 ormative source of instructive guidance and feedback (supervision).  My p
 rior work explores this type of interaction in depth\, as a mechanism for 
 enabling learning for artificial agents.  However\, dependence upon human
  partners for acquiring or adapting skills has important limitations.  Hu
 man time and cognitive load is typically constrained (particularly in real
 istic settings) and data collection from humans\, though potentially quali
 tatively rich\, can be slow and costly to acquire. Yet\, the ability to le
 arn through interaction with other agents represents another powerful mech
 anism for enabling interactive learning.  Though other artificial agents 
 may\nalso\nbe novices\, agents can co-learn through providing each other e
 valuative feedback (reinforcement)\, given the learning task has been suff
 iciently structured and allows for generalization to novel settings.\n\nTh
 is talk presents research that investigates methods for enabling agents to
  learn\ngeneral\ncommunication skills through interactions with\nother age
 nts\n.  In particular\, the talk will focus on my ongoing work within Mul
 ti-Agent Reinforcement Learning\, investigating\nemergent\ncommunication p
 rotocols\, inspired by communication in real-world problem settings.  We 
 present a novel problem setting and a general approach that allows for zer
 o-shot coordination (ZSC)\, i.e.\, discovering protocols that can generali
 ze to independently trained agents.  We also explore and analyze specific
  difficulties associated with finding globally optimal ZSC protocols\, as 
 complexity of the communication task increases or the modality for communi
 cation changes (\ne.g.\nto implicit communication through physical movemen
 t\, by a simulated robotic agent).  Overall\, this work opens up exciting
  avenues for learning\ngeneral\ncommunication protocols in complex domains
 .\n\nBio:\n\nKalesha Bullard is a postdoctoral researcher at Facebook AI R
 esearch.  She completed her PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Institute 
 of Technology in 2019\, where her research focused within the space of int
 eractive robot learning.  During her postdoc\, Kalesha has expanded her r
 esearch to explore the space of multi-agent reinforcement learning\, curre
 ntly investigating how to enable embodied multi-agent populations to learn
 \ngeneral\ncommunication protocols.  More broadly\, Kalesha’s research 
 interests span autonomous reasoning and decision making for artificial age
 nts in multi-agent settings.  To date\, her research has focused on princ
 ipled methods for enabling agents to learn through interaction with other 
 agents (human or artificial) to achieve shared goals. Beyond research\, Ka
 lesha has participated in a number of service roles throughout her researc
 h career\, recently serving on organizing and program committees for works
 hops associated with several top Artificial Intelligence conference venues
  (NeurIPS\, AAAI\, AAMAS).  This past year\, she was selected as one of t
 he 2020 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Rising Stars.\n
