DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\n\nMaria Paola Bonacina\n\, Univer
 sità degli Studi di Verona\n\nHost: Ruzica Piskac\n\nTitle: CDSAT for non
 disjoint theories with shared predicates\n\nAbstract:\n\nMany approaches t
 o the analysis\, verification\, and synthesis of programs require automate
 d reasoning support in the form of decision procedures for satisfiability 
 modulo a combination of theories (SMT). The classical -Oppen scheme for th
 eory combination assumes that the theories are disjoint\, meaning they do 
 not share symbols other than equality. However\, it suffices to enrich the
  theory of arrays with a length function to make it share symbols with ano
 ther theory (e.g.\, linear arithmetic).\n\nIn this talk I present the CDSA
 T paradigm for theory combination and its extension to theories that share
  predicate symbols. CDSAT (Conflict-Driven Satisfiability) handles problem
 s with assignments to first-order variables (satisfiability modulo assignm
 ents)\, works by coordinating theory modules to reason in a conflict-drive
 n manner\, and subsumes the Nelson-Oppen scheme. The extension to shared p
 redicates requires only minimal changes\, and is exemplified for a theory 
 of arrays with extensionality and abstract length. The notion of abstract 
 length admits the traditional interpretation where a length is an integer 
 and the indices of an array form an interval\, but it has also other inter
 pretations. It is precisely this abstraction that makes it possible to sol
 ve the problem by sharing only one predicate symbol.\n\n(Joint work with S
 téphane Graham-Lengrand and Natarajan Shankar)\n\nBio:\n\nMaria Paola Bon
 acina is Professor of Computer Science at the Università degli Studi di V
 erona and International Fellow at the Computer Science Laboratory of SRI I
 nternational (sabbatical year 2021/22). Maria Paola received a Laurea and 
 a Doctorate from the Università degli Studi di Milano\, and a PhD from th
 e State University of New York at Stony Brook. After postdoc’s at the Ar
 gonne National Laboratory and INRIA Lorraine\, she started her career at t
 he University of Iowa\, where she was first Assistant Professor and then A
 ssociate Professor of Computer Science\, receiving NSF RIA and CAREER awar
 ds and a Dean Scholar Award. She was Visiting Professor at the Technische 
 Universität Dresden and at the University of Manchester\, and Visiting Re
 search Scholar at the Isaac Newton Institute (University of Cambridge) and
  at Microsoft Research Redmond. Her research area overlaps with both artif
 icial intelligence and computational logic\, as she works in automated rea
 soning\, including theorem proving\, satisfiability modulo theories\, and 
 their applications.\n\nShe was invited speaker at STRATEGIES (Strategies i
 n Automated Deduction)\, PPDP (Principles and Practice of Declarative Prog
 ramming)\, TABLEAUX (Automated Reasoning by Analytic Tableaux and Related 
 Methods)\, PCR (Parallel Constraint Reasoning)\, FroCoS (Frontiers of Comb
 ining Systems)\, and PxTP (Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving)\, among oth
 er events. She visited many research sites\, including LORIA Nancy\, Unive
 rsität Koblenz-Landau\, MPI Saarbrücken\, Tel Aviv University\, King’s
  College\, EPFL\, ETHZ\, Chalmers University of Technology\, and Universit
 é Paris XI Orsay\, in Europe\; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champ
 aign\, the University of Oregon\, the Argonne National Laboratory\, Stanfo
 rd University\, Iowa State University\, the University of Colorado at Denv
 er\, the University of Idaho\, and CUNY Graduate College\, in America\; th
 e Chinese Academy of Sciences\, East China Normal University\, Tsinghua Un
 iversity\, and National Taiwan University\, in Asia.\n\nShe organizes the 
 2021 and 2023 seminars on automated deduction at Schloss Dagstuhl\, and sh
 e chaired the Skolem Award Committee 2021. She serves regularly on the Pro
 gram Committee of IJCAR (International Joint Conference on Automated Reaso
 ning)\, CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction) for which she was also pr
 ogram chair\, and several other conferences. She was elected thrice to the
  Board of Trustees of CADE Inc.\, and twice President of the Board: in thi
 s capacity\, she chaired the committee that assigns the Herbrand Award\, a
 nd she instituted the CADE Best Paper and the Skolem (test of time) awards

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nZeyu Wang\n\nTitle: 
 Enhancing the Creative Process in Digital Prototyping\n\nAdvisor: Julie Do
 rsey\n\nOther Committee Members:\nHolly Rushmeier\nSteven Zucker\nLeonard 
 McMillan (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nDespite advances in computer-aided design (CAD) systems and video editing
  software\, digital content creation for design\, storytelling\, and inter
 active experiences remains a challenging problem. This dissertation introd
 uces a series of studies\, techniques\, and systems along three thrusts th
 at engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in author
 ing digital content.\n\nFirst\, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotem
 poral analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing trac
 ing\, freehand drawing\, and computer-generated approximations. We found a
  high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used o
 ver time\, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emula
 ting drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique fo
 r line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models\, where our learned style
  space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line draw
 ing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.\n\nS
 econd\, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the 
 creative process in augmented reality through two tablet-based interfaces.
  DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for r
 emote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes\, such as D
 ollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing 
 in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in th
 eir spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the poin
 t cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more
  accessible and versatile.\n\nLast\, we introduce two procedural methods t
 o generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. Ani
 Code supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animati
 ons in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates vi
 deo flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D da
 ta for cultural heritage. Our user studies show that these methods can ben
 efit the video-oriented digital prototyping experience and facilitate the 
 dissemination of creative and cultural ideas.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/e
