DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Social Hour\n\nLast week\, a cohort of 
 Yale CS majors virtually attended two conferences: the\nACM Richard Tapia 
 Celebration of Diversity in Computing\n\, as well as the\nGame Developers 
 of Color Expo\n. In all thanks to\nProf. Theodore Kim’s\ninitiative on t
 his topic\, this week’s CS Social Hour will host these attendees. They w
 ill describe and discuss their experiences at these conferences\, such as 
 what they saw\, and who they met. Come to hear about these experiences\, a
 nd find out how you can help send a Yale contingent (which may include you
 !) to the same conferences next year.\n\nPlease join us on Friday\, Sept. 
 25\nth\nfrom 4:00 – 5:00pm.\n\nZoom link:\n\nJoin from PC\, Mac\, Linux\

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe dates for the Joint Boards of Permanen
 t Officers (JBPO) have been scheduled for the 2020-21 academic year.  Ple
 ase reserve:\n\nThursday\, October 8\, 2020\n\nThursday\, October 29\, 202

 rsday\, April 15\, 2021\n\nThursday\, May 13\, 2021\n\nAll meetings start 
 at 4:00 p.m. and will be via Zoom for the foreseeable future. Two weeks pr
 ior to each meeting\, an email will be sent with the link to preregister f
 or the meeting\, along with the CONFIDENTIAL agenda and supporting materia
 ls. After preregistering you will receive a confirmation email containing 
 the Zoom link to join the meeting.\n\nIn order to ensure a quorum*\, pleas
 e attend if you are able\, especially if you are a designated quorum offic
 er of your department or program.\n\n*Voting in the Joint Boards of Perman
 ent Officers. Full professors whose primary or fully joint appointments ar
 e in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department may vote\, as may full prof
 essors of professional schools with secondary appointments in a Faculty of
  Arts and Sciences department and explicit Corporation approval for such v
 oting rights. The only exception to this rule is for faculty in Molecular 
 Biophysics and Biochemistry who are assigned to vote in the School of Medi
 cine’s Board of Permanent Officers and may not also vote in the Joint Bo
 ards of Permanent Officers of Yale College and the Graduate School. By lon
 g standing custom\, a quorum for the conduct of business at a meeting of t
 he Joint Boards consists of 37 members eligible to vote. No vote has force
  if the number of votes\, plus recorded abstentions\, falls short of that 
 number. Tenure appointments are forwarded to the Corporation only upon an 
 affirmative vote by two-thirds of the members present and eligible to vote
 . All other appointments are approved by majority vote. (Faculty Handbook\

SUMMARY:Computation and Society Colloquium and Computer Science Distinguis
 hed Speaker Series - Bernard Chazelle\, Princeton Univ.
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201009T150000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201009T160000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nComputation and Society Colloquium and Com
 puter Science Distinguished Speaker Series\n\nSpeaker:\nBernard Chazelle\n
 \, Eugene Higgins Professor of Computer Science\, Princeton\n\nTitle: Bui
 lding an Algorithmic Toolkit for Out-of-Equilibrium Systems\n\nHost:\nNish
 eeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAlgorithms research has long been preoccupi
 ed with systems that reach equilibrium: random processes should converge t
 o stationary distributions\; dynamical systems should be attracting or\, a
 t worst\, periodic\; algorithms should terminate and land in a “good” 
 place\; etc. Natural algorithms\, those found in nature\, break all of the
 se rules. What are we to do then? Answer: Build new algorithmic tools. I w
 ill sketch some of my efforts in that direction. The talk will be aimed at
  a general scientific audience and will require no background knowledge.\n
 \n\n\nBio:\nBernard Chazelle (graduate of École des Mines de Paris\, PhD 
 Yale) has been professor at Princeton University since 1986\, where he hol
 ds the Eugene Higgins chair in Computer Science.\n\nAs Director of the NSF
  Center for Computational Intractability\, his research focuses on algorit
 hms and complexity. He has been a visiting professor at École Normale Sup
 érieure (ENS) Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, University of Paris-Sud\, and 
 INRIA. He spent many years as a consultant for Xerox PARC\, DEC SRC\, NEC 
 Research\, (where he chaired the Board of Fellows) and Tsinghua University
  in Beijing. He is\, or was\, member of the Scientific Committee at ENS Ul
 m\, École Polytechnique\, and the Institut Henri Poincaré. He is also a 
 member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the European Acade
 my of Sciences\, ACM Fellow\, Guggenheim Fellow\, and winner of several aw
 ards from the SIAM mathematical society.\n\nA pioneering figure in computa
 tional geometry\, Bernard Chazelle is known for his resolution of a number
  of longstanding open questions in the field. His research has also led hi
 m to investigate the role of randomness in computing\, a subject he took u
 p in his book\, The Discrepancy Method: Randomness and Complexity. In the 
 last few years\, his efforts have focused on “natural algorithms\,” wi
 th the aim of building a bridge between dynamical systems and algorithms f
 rom the living world. Professor Chazelle takes pride in having taught the 
 very first “Integrated Science” program at Princeton University\, toge
 ther with colleagues from physics and biology.\n\n\n\n\nZoom:\nhttps://yal

SUMMARY:CS Distinguished Colloquium - Christos Papdimitriou\, Columbia Uni

DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium\n(This is a jo
 int event with YINS)\n\nSpeaker :\nChristos Papdimitriou\n\, Columbia Uni
 versity\n\nTitle: “Language\, Brain\, and Computation”\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nHow does the brain beget the mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapse
 s effect reasoning\, intelligence\, language?   Despite dazzling progres
 s in experimental neuroscience\, as well as in cognitive science at the ot
 her extreme of scale\, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarc
 hing question – the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to b
 e required.  As Richard Axel recently put it:  “We don’t have a logi
 c for the transformation of neural activity into thought […].”\n\nWhat
  kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?\n\nI will introd
 uce a computational system whose basic data structure is the assembly – 
 assemblies are large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\
 , thoughts\, etc. –\, and which is informed by recent progress in unders
 tanding how language happens in the brain.\n\nBio:\n\nChristos Harilaos Pa
 padimitriou is the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbi
 a University.  Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor at UC
  Berkeley for the previous 22 years\, and before that he taught at Harvard
 \, MIT\, NTU Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five textbooks
  and many articles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applications t
 o optimization\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics and game 
 theory\, the Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a PhD from P
 rinceton (1976)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member of the N
 ational Academy of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of Arts and S
 ciences\, and the National Academy of Engineering\, and he has received th
 e Knuth prize\, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as well as th
 e 2018 Harvey Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the Hellenic r
 epublic named him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He has also wri
 tten three novels: “Turing \,” “Logicomix”  and his latest “Ind
 ependence.”\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-distinguished-colloquium
