 :\n\nIt becomes increasingly difficult to improve the speed-energy efficie
 ncy of traditional digital processors because of limitations in transistor
  scaling and the von Neumann architecture. To address this issue\, computi
 ng systems augmented with emerging devices such as resistance switches off
 er an attractive solution. Because of its non-volatility\, small size\, an
 d fast switching speed\, a resistance switch consumes only a small amount 
 of energy to update the internal state while requires no power to maintain
  the state. Built into large-scale crossbar arrays\, they perform in-memor
 y computing by utilizing physical laws\, such as Ohm’s law for multiplic
 ation and Kirchhoff’s current law for accumulation. The current readout 
 at all columns is finished simultaneously regardless of the array size\, o
 ffering a huge parallelism and hence superior computing throughput.\n\nIn 
 this Lecture\, fundamentals of a number of emerging resistance switching d
 evices\, namely\, PCM\, RRAM\, MRAM and FeRAM will be introduced first. Th
 e required device properties for in-memory computing in artificial neural 
 networks will then be elaborated. Finally\, large array integration and ap
 plications of such emerging hardware as AI accelerators will be discussed.
 \n\nBio:\n\nDr. Xia is a professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at
  UMass Amherst and head of the Nanodevices and Integrated Systems Lab (\nh
 ttp://nano.ecs.umass.edu/\n). Before joining UMass\, he spent three years 
 at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engin
 eering in 2007 from Princeton University. Dr. Xia’s research interests i
 nclude beyond-CMOS devices\, integrated systems and enabling fabrication &
  integration technologies\, with applications in machine intelligence\, re
 configurable RF systems and hardware security. He is a recipient of DARPA

 BDS Seminar Series “Towards Broad and Robust AI”\n\nIrina Rish\, PhD\n

 éal (UdeM) and Core Member of MILA - Quebec AI Institute\n\nZoom link:\nh
 ttps://yale.zoom.us/j/92067328444\n\nAbstract:\n\nModern AI systems have a
 chieved impressive results in many specific domains\, from image and speec
 h recognition to natural language processing and mastering complex games s
 uch as chess and Go. However\, they remain largely inflexible\, fragile an
 d narrow\, unable to continually adapt to a wide range of changing environ
 ments and novel tasks without “catastrophically forgetting” what they 
 have learned before\, to infer higher-order abstractions allowing for syst
 ematic generalization to out-of-distribution data\, and to achieve the lev
 el of robustness necessary to “survive” various perturbations in their
  environment - a natural property of most biological intelligent systems. 
 In this talk\, we will provide a brief overview of several recent advances
  in continual learning (CL) which aim to push AI from “narrow” to “b
 road”\, including unsupervised architectural adaptations inspired by adu
 lt neurogenesis in mammalian brains [1]\; transfer/interference trade-off 
 approaches enforcing gradient alignment across examples\, and combining ex
 perience replay with optimization- based meta-learning [2]\, as well as re
 cently proposed CL framework for quickly solving new\, out-of-distribution
  tasks\, while also allowing for fast remembering of the previous ones [3]
 . The latter framework unifies continual-\, meta-\, meta-continual-\, and 
 continual-meta learning and introduces continual-MAML\, an online extensio
 n of the popular MAML algorithm. We also address the robust representation
  learning problem\, i.e. extracting features invariant to various stochast
 ic and/or adversarial perturbations of theenvironment - a common goal acro
 ss continual-\, meta-\, transfer learning as well as adversarial robustnes
 s\, out-of-distribution generalization\, self-supervised learning\, and re
 lated subfields. As an example\, our  recent Adversarial Feature Desensit
 ization (AFD) approach [4] trains a feature extractor network to generate 
 representations which are both predictive and robust to input perturbation
 s (e.g. adversarial attacks) and demonstrates a significant improvement ov
 er the state-of-the-art\, despite its relative simplicity (i.e.\, feature 
 robustness is enforced via additional adversarial decoder with a GAN-like 
 objective attempting to discriminate between the original and perturbed in
 puts). Finally\, we conclude the talk with a discussion of several directi
 ons for future work\, which including drawing inspirations from neuroscien
 ce\, to develop truly broad and robust AI systems capable of continual\, l
 ifelong learning.\n\nBio:\n\nIrina Rish is an Associate Professor in the C

  Higgins Professor of Computer Science\, Princeton\n\nTitle: Building an A
 lgorithmic Toolkit for Out-of-Equilibrium Systems\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://y
 ale.zoom.us/j/95783107535\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAlg
 orithms research has long been preoccupied with systems that reach equilib
 rium: random processes should converge to stationary distributions\; dynam
 ical systems should be attracting or\, at worst\, periodic\; algorithms sh
 ould terminate and land in a “good” place\; etc. Natural algorithms\, 
 those found in nature\, break all of these rules. What are we to do then? 
 Answer: Build new algorithmic tools. I will sketch some of my efforts in t
 hat direction. The talk will be aimed at a general scientific audience and
  will require no background knowledge.\n\n\n\nBio:\nBernard Chazelle (grad
 uate of École des Mines de Paris\, PhD Yale) has been professor at Prince
 ton University since 1986\, where he holds the Eugene Higgins chair in Com
 puter Science.\n\nAs Director of the NSF Center for Computational Intracta
 bility\, his research focuses on algorithms and complexity. He has been a 
 visiting professor at École Normale Supérieure (ENS) Ulm\, École Polyte
 chnique\, University of Paris-Sud\, and INRIA. He spent many years as a co
 nsultant for Xerox PARC\, DEC SRC\, NEC Research\, (where he chaired the B
 oard of Fellows) and Tsinghua University in Beijing. He is\, or was\, memb
 er of the Scientific Committee at ENS Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, and the
  Institut Henri Poincaré. He is also a member of the American Academy of 
 Arts and Sciences and the European Academy of Sciences\, ACM Fellow\, Gugg
 enheim Fellow\, and winner of several awards from the SIAM mathematical so
 ciety.\n\nA pioneering figure in computational geometry\, Bernard Chazelle
  is known for his resolution of a number of longstanding open questions in
  the field. His research has also led him to investigate the role of rando
 mness in computing\, a subject he took up in his book\, The Discrepancy Me
 thod: Randomness and Complexity. In the last few years\, his efforts have 
 focused on “natural algorithms\,” with the aim of building a bridge be
 tween dynamical systems and algorithms from the living world. Professor Ch
 azelle takes pride in having taught the very first “Integrated Science
 ” program at Princeton University\, together with colleagues from physic
 s and biology.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/computation-and-society-

 rch topics of interest in emerging tech areas for Cisco\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn
  the past few months\, Cisco Research has started focusing on several emer
 ging technology areas of interest to Cisco. In this talk\, I will be talki
 ng a bit about  what these areas are of research interest are\, how we a
 re leveraging and engaging with universities for tech and societal impact.
 \n\nBio:\n\nDr. Ramana Kompella is currently the Head of Research in the E
 merging Technology and Incubation group at Cisco. His previous experience 
 includes co-founding successful startups\, and providing engineering leade
 rship to build world class products currently in use in several hundreds o
 f customers’ data centers. Prior to his industry roles\, he was a tenure
 d faculty at Purdue in Computer Science Department\, where he conducted re
 search on systems and networking areas\, with multi-million dollar grants 
 from NSF and other industry sources. He co-advised several PhD and Masters
  students\, and has co-authored 70+ publications in top networking and sys
 tems conferences such as SIGCOMM. He was the recipient of several awards i
 ncluding the prestigious NSF CAREER award.\n\nJohn Marshall\, Cisco\nTitle
 : Exploring the Potential of Edge Computing\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the growt
 h of end-points\, 5G mobility\, and volumes of data used for analytics\, e
 dge computing brings computation closer to where data is generated that al
 lows machine learning algorithms to provide faster response times and impr
 oved efficiency.  Local processing can also offer autonomous operation im
 proving availability and greater network utilization.\n\nThe benefits are 
 clear\; however\, the definition of the edge will continue to evolve to su
 pport the processing needs of the Internet of Things (IoT).  Architectura
 l trade-offs need to be considered which enables efficient distributed pro
 cessing to occur between IoT devices\, local edge servers\, and cloud comp
 uting resources.  The datacenter’s physical operating environment isn
 ’t able to be easily extended in terms of power delivery\, cooling needs
 \, or even physical space.  Simply using smaller compute units\, CPUs & G
 PUs\, is not sufficient.\n\nTomorrow’s edge computing environment needs 
 to support vastly improved power efficiency over a range of physical opera
 ting environments while enabling a common software-defined framework for o
 perational agility.  Applications will likely adapt to enable edge-comput
 e to augment IoT processing while maintaining data privacy & security.\n\n
 Bio:\n\nJohn Marshall is a Distinguished Engineer at Cisco Systems.  His 
 interest in network innovation includes programmable data planes\, network
  processor architecture\, and high-performance packet classification.  Hi
 s current focus is on the development of a next-generation Data Processing
  Unit (DPU) for edge computing.  John has held numerous silicon architect
 ural and design roles at Cisco involving the application advanced memory t
 echnologies.\n\nBefore joining Cisco\, he worked for IBM as a senior desig
 ner in disciplines that include network processors\, switch fabrics\, and 
 vector processing.  John holds over 25 patents in processor and system de
 sign.  He also has several publications in the areas of computer architec
 ture & networking.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-distinguished-collo

 /yale.zoom.us/j/9274859808\n\nHost: Yang Cai\n\nAbstract:\n\nHow does the 
 brain beget the mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapses effect reaso
 ning\, intelligence\, language?   Despite dazzling progress in experimen
 tal neuroscience\, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of
  scale\, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question 
 – the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required.  
 As Richard Axel recently put it:  “We don’t have a logic for the tran
 sformation of neural activity into thought […].”\n\nWhat kind of forma
 l system would qualify as this “logic”?\n\nI will introduce a computat
 ional system whose basic data structure is the assembly – assemblies are
  large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\, thoughts\, e
 tc. –\, and which is informed by recent progress in understanding how la
 nguage happens in the brain.\n\nBio:\n\nChristos Harilaos Papadimitriou is
  the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.
   Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor at UC Berkeley for
  the previous 22 years\, and before that he taught at Harvard\, MIT\, NTU 
 Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five textbooks and many art
 icles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applications to optimizatio
 n\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics and game theory\, the 
 Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a PhD from Princeton (197
 6)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member of the National Acade
 my of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and
  the National Academy of Engineering\, and he has received the Knuth prize
 \, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as well as the 2018 Harvey
  Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the Hellenic republic named
  him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He has also written three no
 vels: “Turing \,” “Logicomix”  and his latest “Independence.”

 st: Yang Cai\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/92748598082\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nOver the last two decades we have developed good understanding how to
  quantify the impact of strategic user behavior on overall performance in 
 many games (including traffic routing as well as online auctions)\, and sh
 owed that the resulting bounds extend to repeated games assuming players u
 se a form of no-regret learning that helps them adapt to the environment.
   Unfortunately these results do not apply when outcomes in one iteration
  effect the game in the future\, which is typically the case in applicatio
 ns. In this talk we will study this phenomenon in the context of a game mo
 deling queuing systems: routers compete for servers\, where packets that d
 o not get service will be resent at future rounds\, resulting in a system 
 where the number of packets at each round depends on the success of the ro
 uters in the previous rounds. In joint work with Jason Gaitonde\, we analy
 ze the resulting highly dependent random process and find that if the capa
 city of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeabl
 e scheduler to get all packets served even with double the packet arrival 
 rate\, then learning can help the queues in coordinating their behavior\, 
 the expected number of packets in the queues will remain bounded throughou
 t time\, assuming older packets have priority.\n\nBio:\n\nÉva Tardos is
