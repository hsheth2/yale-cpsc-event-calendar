  Information Science\, Cornell University\n\nTitle: “Fairness and Bias i
 n Algorithmic Decision-Making”\n\nZoom Link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/925
 73843263\n\nHost: Professor Elisa Celis\, Department of Statistics and Dat
 a Science\n\nAbstract\n:\n\nAs algorithms trained via machine learning are
  increasingly used as a component of screening decisions in areas such as 
 hiring\, lending\, and education\, discussion in the public sphere has tur
 ned to the question of what it means for algorithmic classification to be 
 fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairness conditio
 ns that lie at the heart of these debates\, and discuss recent research es
 tablishing inherent trade-offs between these conditions. We also explore h
 ow the complexity of a classification rule interacts with its fairness pro
 perties\, showing how natural ways of approximating a classifier via a sim
 pler rule can act in conflict with fairness goals.\n\nThe talk will be bas
 ed on joint work with Jens Ludwig\, Sendhil Mullainathan\, Manish Raghavan
 \, and Cass Sunstein.\n\nBio:\n\nJon Kleinberg is the Tisch University Pro
 fessor in the Departments of Computer Science and Information Science at C
 ornell University. His research focuses on the interaction of algorithms a
 nd networks\, the roles they play in large-scale social and information sy
 stems\, and their broader societal implications. He is a member of the Nat
 ional Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering\, and th
 e recipient of MacArthur\, Packard\, Simons\, Sloan\, and Vannevar Bush re
 search fellowships\, as well awards including the Harvey Prize\, the Nevan

SUMMARY:CS Distinguished Colloquium - Eva Tardos\, Cornell University

 st: Yang Cai\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/92748598082\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nOver the last two decades we have developed good understanding how to
  quantify the impact of strategic user behavior on overall performance in 
 many games (including traffic routing as well as online auctions)\, and sh
 owed that the resulting bounds extend to repeated games assuming players u
 se a form of no-regret learning that helps them adapt to the environment.
   Unfortunately these results do not apply when outcomes in one iteration
  effect the game in the future\, which is typically the case in applicatio
 ns. In this talk we will study this phenomenon in the context of a game mo
 deling queuing systems: routers compete for servers\, where packets that d
 o not get service will be resent at future rounds\, resulting in a system 
 where the number of packets at each round depends on the success of the ro
 uters in the previous rounds. In joint work with Jason Gaitonde\, we analy
 ze the resulting highly dependent random process and find that if the capa
 city of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeabl
 e scheduler to get all packets served even with double the packet arrival 
 rate\, then learning can help the queues in coordinating their behavior\, 
 the expected number of packets in the queues will remain bounded throughou
 t time\, assuming older packets have priority.\n\nBio:\n\nÉva Tardos is

 cially if you are a designated quorum officer of your department or progra
 m.\n\n*Voting in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers. Full professors w
 hose primary or fully joint appointments are in a Faculty of Arts and Scie
 nces department may vote\, as may full professors of professional schools 
 with secondary appointments in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department a
 nd explicit Corporation approval for such voting rights. The only exceptio
 n to this rule is for faculty in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry who
  are assigned to vote in the School of Medicine’s Board of Permanent Off
 icers and may not also vote in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers of Y
 ale College and the Graduate School. By long standing custom\, a quorum fo
 r the conduct of business at a meeting of the Joint Boards consists of 37 
 members eligible to vote. No vote has force if the number of votes\, plus 
 recorded abstentions\, falls short of that number. Tenure appointments are
  forwarded to the Corporation only upon an affirmative vote by two-thirds 
 of the members present and eligible to vote. All other appointments are ap
 proved by majority vote. (Faculty Handbook\, Section IV.F.5)\n\nYale Unive

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\n\nSpeaker: Theodore Kim\, Y

 he algorithms used for Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) in film today were
  developed over the course of the last 45 years. In the beginning\, they c
 ould only depict a limited set of visual phenomena\, which filmmakers took
  up as a creative challenge. These early efforts resulted in some of the m
 ost memorable images in cinema\, from\nToy Story\nto\nTerminator 2: Judgem
 ent Day\n. However\, as these CGI gained more attention and attracted more
  money\, the insidious effects of systemic racism crept into the design of
  subsequent algorithms. As a result\, the techniques for rendering digital
  “humans” we use today were specifically designed to depict the domina
 nt visual features of young\, white people. In this talk\, I will describe
  how we got here\, what it might mean\, and where we can go next.\n\nBio:\
 n\nTheodore Kim is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Yale Univ
 ersity\, where he investigates biomechanical solids\, fluid dynamics\, and
  selected topics in geometry. Previously\, he was a Senior Research Scient
 ist at Pixar Animation Studios. He is the recipient of the NSF CAREER Awar
 d\, multiple Best Paper awards\, and a Scientific and Technical Academy Aw
 ard (SciTech Oscar). His first (uncredited) work appeared on-screen on the
  Sorting Hat in\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\n.\n\n\nhttps://c

 d Kim\n\nAbstract:\n\nHair simulation in animated feature films presents m
 any challenges\, ranging from incorporating artistic control to dealing wi
 th extreme\, non-physical character motion. In a production environment\, 
 hair simulation needs to be fast\, stable\, and usable without excessive p
 arameter tuning in order to produce content efficiently. These challenges 
 only increase when simulating a variety of hair styles on numerous charact
 ers in the film. In this talk I will present our method for stably simulat
 ing stylized hair that addresses these artistic needs and performance dema
 nds. In addition to the underlying hair model that defines the physical mo
 tion\, I will discuss various artistic controls and approaches used to pro
 duce our final hair simulations in several feature films.\n\nBio:\n\nHayle
 y Iben is the Director of Engineering for Applications in the Software R&D
  department at Pixar Animation Studios. Her teams are responsible for film
  production technologies for sets\, layout\, characters\, shading\, crowds
 \, animation\, simulation\, lighting and rendering. Prior to undertaking t
 his role\, Hayley led the engineering team responsible for character simul
 ation technologies\, including cloth\, hair\, flesh\, and skin\, for seven
  of her fourteen years at the studio. Hayley’s expertise is in hair simu
 lation and she has been developing the studio’s hair technology\, Taz\, 
 that debuted in Disney Pixar’s “Brave”. She has also built tools for
  character articulation and animation\, focusing on inverse kinematics and
  mathematical techniques. Hayley earned a B.S. in computer science from Du
 quesne University and a M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Univer
 sity of California\, Berkeley.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-disting
