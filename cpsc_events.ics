DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nIshan Agarwal\n\nHost: Holly Rush
 meier\n\nTitle: An Introduction to Recursion\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecursion is 
 a powerful idea which shows up not only in computer science\, but also i
 n other fields. It forms the basis of many interesting structures and pro
 blem solving approaches\, a few of which we will see in this talk. We will
  look at how recursion can be used to define functions\, mathematical obje
 cts and data structures\, as well as how it can be a powerful problem solv
 ing tool\; often allowing us to come up with clear and intelligible soluti
 ons to problems that are otherwise hard to attack. You can also expect 
 to see some other fun instances of recursion\, which might surprise you!\
 n\nBio:\n\nI’m Ishan Agarwal\, a final year PhD student at NYU. I have a
  broad interest in theoretical computer science. The areas I have explored
  so far include various topics in algorithmic game theory (my thesis work
  is on stable matchings and more generally matching markets)\, metric geom
 etry (low distortion lattice embeddings) and computational geometry (color
 ings of point sets in the plane). Currently I am working on novel variatio
 ns of the online matching problem.\n\nPerhaps even more so than research\,
  I am very passionate about teaching. I have had the good fortune to have 
 several rewarding teaching experiences at NYU and I am aiming to make the 
 focus of my career going forward.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk

 lly Rushmeier\n\nTitle of Teaching Demo:  ”Understanding K-Means Clust
 ering Machine Learning”\n\nAbstract:\n\n“There is a growing amount of 
 data that is being generated today. Data scientists are attempting to tur
 n large datasets from industries like business\, healthcare\, and social m
 edia into actionable insights and data-driven decisions. With the advent 
 of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)\, machines are g
 etting more and more advanced and their abilities are frequently pushed to
  the limit. Over the last decade\, ML has made huge progress in technolog
 y in everything from photo recognition to self-driving cars. ”Unsupervi
 sed Machine Learning” draws inferences from datasets without labels. If
  we don’t know what we’re looking for\, it’s great for finding patte
 rns. Since labeled data is difficult or expensive to gather\, many real-wo
 rld datasets are unlabeled or partially labeled\, making unsupervised lear
 ning approaches like k-means clustering valuable tools for dealing with la
 rge amounts of unlabeled data. Due to its simplicity\, efficiency\, and in
 terpretation\, K-means clustering is one of the most used unsupervised lea
 rning techniques for grouping related data points. In this lecture\, I wil
 l talk about what is k-means clustering and how it works\, which can hel
 p us to understand our data in a unique way by grouping or dividing data i
 nto groups. ”\n\nBio:\n\nFardina Fathmiul Alam is a Ph.D. candidate in 
 the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University (GMU) in Fai
 rfax\, Virginia. In addition\, She works as a Graduate Research Assistant 
 in Dr. Amarda Shehu’s Computational Biology Lab at GMU. Her research fo
 cuses on Machine Learning (ML)\, specifically the intersection of Deep Lea
 rning (DL) with bioinformatics and computational biology. She works on 
 designing novel deep neural-network-based latent variable models to organi
 ze high-dimensional\, non-linear molecular structure space (in terms of re
 presentation learning)\, and for that her application domain is Protein St
 ructure data. Fardina already has a good number of publications in her wor
 k. In 2013\, She received her undergraduate degree in Computer Science an
 d Engineering from the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST)
  in Dhaka\, Bangladesh. She earned her MS degree in Computer Science from 
 Mason. She worked for about four years as a Full-Time Teaching Faculty (Le
 cturer) at the International University of Business\, Agriculture\, and Te
 chnology (IUBAT) in Dhaka\, Bangladesh\, before joining Mason. She also
  spent about 3 years at Mason as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for variou
 s graduate and undergraduate courses. Fardina intends to complete my Ph.
 D. by the end of the Spring of 2023.”\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/c

 ibisono\n\nTitle: Towards the Statistically Principled Design of ML Algori
 thms\n\nAbstract:\n\nWhat are the optimal algorithms for learning from dat
 a? Have we found them already\, or are better ones out there to be discove
 red? Making these questions precise\, and answering them\, requires taking
  on the mathematically deep interplay between statistical and computationa
 l constraints.  It also requires reconciling our theoretical toolbox with
  surprising new phenomena arising from practice\, which seem to violate co
 nventional rules of thumb regarding algorithm and model design. I will dis
 cuss progress along these lines: in terms of designing new algorithms for 
 basic learning problems\, controlling generalization in large statistical 
 models\, and understanding key statistical questions for generative modeli
 ng.\n\nBio:\n\nFrederic is currently a Motwani Postdoctoral Fellow in the
  Department of Computer Science at Stanford University.  He was previous
 ly a research fellow at the Simons Institute\, and before that received
  his PHD in\nMathematics and Statistics.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/

 \n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite extraordinary progress\, current machine learning
  systems have been shown to be brittle against adversarial examples: seemi
 ngly innocuous but carefully crafted perturbations of test examples that c
 ause machine learning predictors to misclassify. Can we learn predictors r
 obust to adversarial examples? and how? There has been much empirical inte
 rest in this major challenge in machine learning\, and in this talk\, we w
 ill present a theoretical perspective. We will illustrate the need to go b
 eyond traditional approaches and principles\, such as empirical (robust) r
 isk minimization\, and present new algorithmic ideas with stronger robust 
 learning guarantees.\n\nBio:\n\nOmar Montasser is a PhD candidate at TTI-C
 hicago advised by Nathan Srebro. His research broadly explores the theory 
 and foundations of machine learning. Recently\, his research has focused o
 n understanding and characterizing adversarially robust learning\, and on 
 designing learning algorithms with provable robustness guarantees under di
 fferent settings. His work has been recognized by a best student paper awa
 rd at COLT (2019).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-omar-montasser
