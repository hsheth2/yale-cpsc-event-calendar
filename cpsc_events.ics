DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJoohyung Kim\, University o
 f Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nHost: Marynel Vazquez\n\nTitle: Towards 
 Human-Friendly Robots\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe demand for robots which can work
  closely and interact physically with human has been growing. Such robots 
 can already be found guiding\, serving\, and entertaining people in some p
 laces\, such as airports\, restaurants\, and amusement parks. However\, de
 spite advances in related technologies\, there are very few robotic applic
 ations to meet the publicâ€™s expectations. To make robots help humans in 
 daily life\, we need better understanding of human evironments and tasks\,
  better methods to perform the tasks through robots\, and better design to
  interact with human naturally and safely. In this talk\, I will present m
 y works and experience to make human-friendly robots by means of robot des
 ign\, motion control\, and human-robot interaction.\n\nBio:\n\nJoohyung Ki
 m is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineeri
 ng in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on 
 design and control for humanoid robots\, system for motion learning in rob
 ot hardware\, and safe human-robot interaction. He received BSE and Ph.D. 
 degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Seoul N
 ational University\, Korea\, in 2001 and 2012. He was with Disney Research
  as a Research Scientist from 2013 to 2019. Prior to joining Disney\, he w
 as a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon Univ
 ersity for DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2013. From 2009 to 2012\, he was a 
 Research Staff Member in Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\, Korea\
 , developing biped walking controllers for humanoid robots.\n\n\nhttps://c
