DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nMatt Weinberg\, Princeton Univers
 ity\n\nHost: Yang Cai\n\nTitle: (a biased selection of) Recent Development
 s in Combinatorial Auctions\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn a combinatorial auction the
 re are m items\, and each of n players has a valuation functionv_i which m
 aps sets of items to non-negative reals. A designer wishes to partition th
 e items into S_1\,…\,S_n to maximize the welfare (sum_iv_i(S_i) )\, perh
 aps assuming that allv_i lie in some class V (such as submodular\, subaddi
 tive\, etc.).\n\nWithin Algorithmic Game Theory\, this problem serves as a
  lens through which to examine the interplay between computation and incen
 tives. For example: is it the case that whenever a poly-time/poly-communic
 ation algorithm for honest players can achieve an approximation guarantee 
 of c when all valuations lie in V\, a poly-time/poly-communication truthfu
 l mechanism for strategic players can achieve an approximation guarantee o
 f c when all valuations lie in V as well?\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll give a 
 brief history\, then survey three recent results on this topic which:\n\n-
  provide the first separation between achievable guarantees of poly-commun
 ication algorithms and poly-communication truthful mechanisms for any V (j
 oint works with Mark Braverman and Jieming Mao\, and with Sepehr Assadi\, 
 Hrishikesh Khandeparkar\, and Raghuvansh Saxena).\n\n- resolve the communi
 cation complexity of combinatorial auctions for two subadditive players (j
 oint work with Tomer Ezra\, Michal Feldman\, Eric Neyman\, and Inbal Talga
 m-Cohen).\n\n- revisit existing separations between poly-time algorithms a
 nd poly-time truthful mechanisms via a solution concept we call “Impleme
 ntation in Advised Strategies” (joint work with Linda Cai and Clayton Th
 omas).\n\nBio:\n\nMatt Weinberg is an assistant professor of computer scie
 nce at Princeton University. Before that\, he was also a postdoc at Prince
 ton CS\, and a research fellow at the Simons Institute (Algorithmic Game T
 heory in 2015\, and Algorithms and Uncertainty in 2016). He received his P
 hD from MIT in 2014 with Costis Daskalakis.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/eve

 nTitle: Finite automata and algebraic equations mod p\n\nHost: Dana Anglui
 n\n\nAbstract:\n\nA finite automaton is a very limited model of a computer
 \, which assigns an output to every possible input string over a given alp
 habet. Choosing a base p\, we can represent non-negative integers as strin
 gs (their base-p expansions) by using the alphabet {0\,1\,…\,p-1}.  In 
 this way\, an automaton can generate a sequence: it takes the integers  0
 \,1\,2\,3\,…\, reads their base-p expansions as input\, and produces the
  sequence a_0\,a_1\,a_2\,a_3\,… as output.  We can then form a power se
 ries by writing\n\ny = a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 + a_3*x^3+…\n\nIf p is a pr
 ime number and we perform arithmetic mod p\, this power series is always a
  solution to an algebraic equation like\ny^2 = 1+x^3.  Amazingly\, the co
 nverse is also true: working mod p\, the sequence of coefficients of an al
 gebraic power series can always be generated by some finite automaton.  T
 his is known as Christol’s theorem.\n\nI will go through some examples t
 o explain how Christol’s theorem works\, then explore some connections b
 etween the size of the automaton and the complexity of the algebraic funct
 ion.\n\n(This talk will also be accessible to undergraduates.)\n\nBio:\n\n
 Andrew Bridy is a lecturer in Computer Science and Political Science at Ya
 le.  He received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsi
 n in 2014 under the supervision of Eric Bach.\n\nHis research interests ar
 e in number theory\, algebraic geometry\, and their connections to theoret
 ical computer science.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-talk-andrew-bri

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSimon S. Du\n\nHosts: Dan S
 pielman (DS) & Nisheeth Vishnoi (CS)\n(https://statistics.yale.edu/seminar
 s/sdscs-joint-seminar-simon-s-du)\n\nTitle: Foundations of Intelligent Sys
 tems with (Deep) Function Approximators\n\nAbstract:\n\nFunction approxima
 tors\, such as deep neural networks\, play a crucial role in building inte
 lligent systems that make predictions and decisions. In this talk\, I will
  discuss my work on understanding\, designing\, and applying function appr
 oximators. First\, I will focus on understanding deep neural networks. The
  main result is that the over-parameterized neural network is equivalent t
 o a new kernel\, Neural Tangent Kernel. This equivalence implies two surpr
 ising phenomena: 1) the simple algorithm gradient descent provably finds t
 he global optimum of the highly non-convex empirical risk\, and 2) the lea
 rned neural network generalizes well despite being highly over-parameteriz
 ed. Furthermore\, this equivalence helps us design a new class of function
  approximators: we transform (fully-connected\, graph\, convolutional) neu
 ral networks to (fully-connected\, graph\, convolutional) Neural Tangent K
 ernels\, which achieve superior performance on standard benchmarks. In the
  second part of the talk\, I will focus on applying function approximators
  to decision-making\, aka reinforcement learning\, problems. In sharp cont
 rast to the (simpler) supervised prediction problems\, solving reinforceme
 nt learning problems requires an exponential number of samples\, even if o
 ne applies function approximators.  I will then discuss what additional s
 tructures that permit statistically efficient algorithms.\n\nBio: Simon S.
  Du is a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton\, hosted
  by Sanjeev Arora. He completed his Ph.D. in Machine Learning at Carnegie 
 Mellon University\, where he was co-advised by Aarti Singh and Barnabás P
 óczos. Previously\, he studied EECS and EMS at UC Berkeley. He has also s
 pent time at Simons Institute and research labs of Facebook\, Google\, and
  Microsoft. His research interests are broadly in machine learning\, with 
 a focus on the foundations of deep learning and reinforcement learning.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium - Oana Balmau\n\nCoffee avai
 lable at 3:45\n\nHost: Avi Silberschatz\n\nTitle: Redesigning Storage Syst
 ems for Future Workloads\, Hardware\, and Performance Requirements\n\nAbst
 ract:\n\nThe storage stack needs to undergo radical change to keep up with
  future workloads\, hardware\, and performance requirements. First\, workl
 oads evolved from following a read-heavy pattern (e.g.\, a static web-page
 ) to a\nwrite-heavy\nprofile where the read:write ratio is closer to 1:1 (
 e.g.\, users’ actions are being recorded\,\nwhile\nthey are browsing web
 -pages). Second\, the hardware is undergoing rapid changes.  The divide b
 etween fine-grained volatile memory and slow block-level storage is rapidl
 y being bridged by the emerging byte-addressable non-volatile memory devic
 es and the fast block-addressable NVMe SSDs (e.g.\, Intel Optane NVMe SSDs
 ). Third\, performance requirements in storage systems now emphasize low t
 ail latency\, in addition to high throughput. In this talk I discuss the m
 ain storage systems challenges raised by future workloads\, hardware\, and
  performance requirements\, and present a new design paradigm for key-valu
 e stores to efficiently handle write-heavy workloads. Existing storage sys
 tems have fundamental limitations that do not allow them to fully leverage
  modern hardware. These limitations stem from the longstanding idea that s
 torage systems need to optimize storage device usage. However\, new storag
 e hardware shifts the bottleneck from I/O to CPU. Based on this key observ
 ation\, I introduce a new key-value store design which minimizes the use o
 f CPU\, to achieve good performance on block-addressable NVMe SSDs. The ov
 erarching principles that optimize CPU use are: (1) avoid maintaining the 
 data sorted on-disk\, (2) minimize contention due to shared data structure
 s\, and (3) remove expensive maintenance operations ran internally by the 
 key-value store.\n\nBio:\n\nOana Balmau is a PhD candidate in the School o
 f Computer Science at the University of Sydney\, advised by Prof. Willy Zw
 aenepoel. She earned her Bachelors and Masters degrees in Computer Science
  from EPFL\, Switzerland. Her research interests are computer systems and 
 storage technologies. Currently\, she is working towards redesigning stora
 ge systems\, aimed at future workloads and hardware. (Homepage:\noanabalma

 itle: Towards Human-Centered AI: Understanding Language in Social Contexts
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nLanguage plays a central role in shaping human behavior a
 nd opinions. However\, understanding language in social contexts is challe
 nging. For instance\, it is well recognized that humans struggle with dete
 cting deception. Such challenging tasks suggest that AI algorithms can dis
 cover new knowledge from data beyond simply emulating human behavior. This
  discovering mode gives rise to opportunities and challenges of augmenting
  humans with AI. In this talk\, I will first present methods for advancing
  AI in the discovering mode: 1) deriving insights from a text corpus by de
 veloping a neural framework for incorporating document metadata such as to
 ne\; 2) identifying the effect of wording in information diffusion by cont
 rolling for confounding factors through natural experiments. I will then s
 hare our recent effort in developing best practices for incorporating AI i
 nto human decision making in such challenging tasks\, using deceptive revi
 ew detection as a testbed. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between huma
 n performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predi
 ctions can moderate this tradeoff.\n\nBio:\n\nChenhao Tan is an assistant 
 professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He ob
 tained his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell Uni
 versity and bachelor’s degrees in computer science and in economics from
  Tsinghua University. Prior to joining CU Boulder\, he spent a year at the
  University of Washington as a postdoc. His research interests include hum
 an-centered AI\, natural language processing\, and computational social sc
 ience. His work has been covered by many news media outlets\, such as the 
 New York Times and the Washington Post. He also won an NSF CRII award\, a 
 Salesforce research award\, a Facebook fellowship\, and a Yahoo! Key Scien
 tific Challenges award.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-che
