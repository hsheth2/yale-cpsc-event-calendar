DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nMatt Weinberg\, Princeton Univers
 ity\n\nHost: Yang Cai\n\nTitle: (a biased selection of) Recent Development
 s in Combinatorial Auctions\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn a combinatorial auction the
 re are m items\, and each of n players has a valuation functionv_i which m
 aps sets of items to non-negative reals. A designer wishes to partition th
 e items into S_1\,…\,S_n to maximize the welfare (sum_iv_i(S_i) )\, perh
 aps assuming that allv_i lie in some class V (such as submodular\, subaddi
 tive\, etc.).\n\nWithin Algorithmic Game Theory\, this problem serves as a
  lens through which to examine the interplay between computation and incen
 tives. For example: is it the case that whenever a poly-time/poly-communic
 ation algorithm for honest players can achieve an approximation guarantee 
 of c when all valuations lie in V\, a poly-time/poly-communication truthfu
 l mechanism for strategic players can achieve an approximation guarantee o
 f c when all valuations lie in V as well?\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll give a 
 brief history\, then survey three recent results on this topic which:\n\n-
  provide the first separation between achievable guarantees of poly-commun
 ication algorithms and poly-communication truthful mechanisms for any V (j
 oint works with Mark Braverman and Jieming Mao\, and with Sepehr Assadi\, 
 Hrishikesh Khandeparkar\, and Raghuvansh Saxena).\n\n- resolve the communi
 cation complexity of combinatorial auctions for two subadditive players (j
 oint work with Tomer Ezra\, Michal Feldman\, Eric Neyman\, and Inbal Talga
 m-Cohen).\n\n- revisit existing separations between poly-time algorithms a
 nd poly-time truthful mechanisms via a solution concept we call “Impleme
 ntation in Advised Strategies” (joint work with Linda Cai and Clayton Th
 omas).\n\nBio:\n\nMatt Weinberg is an assistant professor of computer scie
 nce at Princeton University. Before that\, he was also a postdoc at Prince
 ton CS\, and a research fellow at the Simons Institute (Algorithmic Game T
 heory in 2015\, and Algorithms and Uncertainty in 2016). He received his P
 hD from MIT in 2014 with Costis Daskalakis.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/eve

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Oana Balmau

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium - Oana Balmau\n\nHost: Avi S
 ilberschatz\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe storage stack needs to undergo radical cha
 nge to keep up with future workloads and hardware. The evolution of worklo
 ad profiles in cloud computing poses an important challenge for efficient 
 data management. Storage systems need to be able to simultaneously absorb 
 and fetch huge amounts of data. Workloads evolved from following a “writ
 e once\, read mostly” pattern (e.g.\, a static web-page that is rarely u
 pdated\, but accessed many times by users who wish to read the web-page co
 ntent) to a mixed profile where the read:write ratio is closer to 1:1 (e.g
 .\, users still access web pages to get content\, but their actions are al
 so being simultaneously recorded\, as they are browsing). The hardware is 
 undergoing rapid changes as well. The divide between fine-grained volatile
  memory and slow block-level storage is rapidly being bridged by the emerg
 ing byte-addressable non-volatile memory devices and the fast block-addres
 sable NVMe SSDs (e.g.\, Intel Optane NVMe SSDs). Existing storage systems 
 have fundamental limitations that do not allow them to fully leverage mode
 rn storage hardware. In this talk I discuss the main storage systems chall
 enges raised by future workloads\, hardware\, and performance requirements
 \, and present a new design paradigm for key-value stores to efficiently h
 andle mixed workloads\, running on new NVMe SSDs.\n\nBio:\n\nOana Balmau i
 s a PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science at the University of S
 ydney\, advised by Prof. Willy Zwaenepoel. She earned her Bachelors and Ma
 sters degrees in Computer Science from EPFL\, Switzerland. Her research in
 terests are computer systems and storage technologies. Currently\, she is 
 working towards redesigning storage systems\, aimed at future workloads an
 d hardware. (Homepage:\noanabalmau.com\n.).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/eve
