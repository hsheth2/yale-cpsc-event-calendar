 tle: Physically Interactive Intelligence — A path towards autonomous emb
 odied agents\n\nHost: Brian Scassellati\n\nTitle: Physically Interactive I
 ntelligence — A path towards autonomous embodied agents\n\nAbstract:\n\n
 What is the role of physical interaction in intelligent behavior? When rob
 ots perform tasks in uncontrolled environments like homes or offices\, phy
 sical interaction is often reduced to a minimum because it is considered 
 difficult to plan\, control and execute\, has unpredictable effects and ma
 y be dangerous for the robot and anything or anyone around it. To compensa
 te\, we impose on them extremely high requirements on computation: percep
 tion\, planning and control. However\, when observing humans\, we see that
  our autonomy to act “intelligently”\, to perform tasks in a versatile
  and robust manner\, comes from rich and continuous interactions with the
  environment that relax the dependency on accurate computation and help us
  achieve our tasks.\n\nIn my research\, I study a new balance between inte
 raction and computation in fully integrated robotic systems. My goal is to
  increase their autonomy. To this end\, I propose to promote physical inte
 raction to foundational component of novel robotic solutions. I will pres
 ent new methods to learn to control and exploit physical interactions that
  enable new levels of autonomy in robotics\, even for tasks where interact
 ions are traditionally not exploited such as perception and navigation. T
 hese methods support my overall research hypothesis: autonomous behavior a
 nd grounded understanding in embodied AI agents are achieved through an i
 ntelligent use of physical interaction with the environment\, i.e. through
  physically interactive intelligence. I will also discuss next steps in my
  research agenda to study the role of physical interaction in intelligent
  autonomous behavior and endow robots with new interactive capabilities t
 o achieve tasks in homes and offices.\n\nBio:\n\nRoberto Martin-Martin wor
 ks as Postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab with Pr
 ofessors Silvio Savarese and Fei-Fei Li. There\, he works with three group
 s: the People\, AI & Robots (PAIR) team\, where they study visuo-motor le
 arning skills for manipulation and planning\, and the iGibson team\, where
  they research how humans and robots achieve everyday long-horizon interac
 tive tasks\, and the JackRabbot team\, where they focus on mobility and m
 anipulation in environments with humans. In his research\, he incorporate 
 interactions with the environment as part of novel perception and learning
  methods\, evaluating his algorithms in fully integrated robotic systems.
  His research has been awarded with the RSS Best Systems Paper award\, and
  as winner entry of the Amazon Picking Challenge. He received his PhD and 
 Masters degree from Technische Universität Berlin (TUB) working with Pro
 fessor Oliver Brock on interactive perception\, and his BSc. degree from U

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nBenjamin Fisch\n\nTitle: Pr
 oof systems for governance\, transparency\, and privacy\n\n\nHost: Zhong S
 hao\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecord-keeping has long played a critical role in soci
 ety\, from governing property ownership to establishing historical “trut
 h”. Today\, our dependence on digital records is becoming absolute\, fro
 m our personal wealth\, commerce\, and identities to sources of knowledge 
 and news. This has elevated the importance of three competing dimensions: 
 Who has control over how records are managed? Who can verify the integrity
  of record maintenance? Who can see the information in records? Over the l
 ast decade\, these questions have sparked the development of digital recor
 d-keeping systems called “blockchains”.\n\nThis talk will cover three 
 proof systems that bring new capabilities for governance\, transparency\, 
 and privacy in blockchains. I will first talk about new techniques for bal
 ancing transparency and privacy that achieve order-of-magnitude efficiency
  improvements over the prior state of the art. Next\, I will talk about tw
 o new proof systems pertaining to governance: Verifiable Delay Functions (
 VDFs) and Proofs-of-Replication (PoReps). VDFs enable an unbiased leader e
 lection protocol that will be used within the consensus of Ethereum 2.0. P
 oReps enable a “permission-less” consensus protocol where voting power
  is based on data storage capacity instead of Bitcoin’s energy-wasteful 
 “proof-of-work”. PoReps are deployed in Filecoin\, a decentralized sto
 rage network exceeding a capacity of two exabytes that secures a cryptocur
 rency worth over two billion dollars.\n\nBio:\n\nBen is a PhD candidate at
  Stanford University advised by Dan Boneh and a recipient of the NSF Gradu
 ate Research Fellowship. His research focuses on verifiability in informat
 ion systems\, with special attention on applications of applied cryptograp
 hy to blockchains. Several of his research results have had an impact on t
 he blockchain industry. His seminal work on Verifiable Delay Functions (VD
 Fs) sparked the VDF Alliance\, a multi-million initiative composed of acad
 emic\, non-profit\, and corporate collaborators. VDFs will play an importa
 nt role in several deployed blockchains including\nEthereum\n.\n\n*Contact

 le: Communication Skills Training Using Virtual Agents\n\nHost: Holly Rush
 meier\n\nAbstract:\n\nCommunication skills are essential for effective com
 munication and healthy social life. Past research has linked poor communic
 ation skills with social isolation\, depression\, and anxiety. Unfortunate
 ly\, more than half of the individuals with communication skills deficits 
 such as autism spectrum disorder\, do not get their required behavioral th
 erapy due to the number of available therapists\, cost\, and social stigma
 . We present an online virtual agent that helps improve communication skil
 ls. The virtual agent is capable of having an open-ended conversation with
  individuals and gives both real-time and post conversation feedback on ve
 rbal and nonverbal cues. We evaluated the efficacy of the virtual agent-ba
 sed intervention in three different contexts. Our first evaluation involve
 d 48 college students with communication deficits. The second application 
 involved 18 older adults (65+ years old) with social isolation. The third 
 target population was oncologists who were looking for improving prognosis
  understanding among cancer patients. Through multiple usability and rando
 mized control studies\, we found that the participants who used the virtua
 l agent as a communication skills trainer were more successful in demonstr
 ating their skills in face-to-face conversations than those who used other
  online alternatives.\n\nBio:\n\nMohammad Rafayet Ali received his Ph.D. i

 ilistic proofs in real-world applications have seen explosive growth. Thes
 e systems build upon some of the crown jewels of theoretical computer scie

 f settings.\n\nThis talk describes my work building systems that answer qu
 estions ranging from “how can we build trustworthy hardware that uses un
 trusted components?” to “how can we reduce the cost of verifying smart
  contract execution in blockchains?” Along the way\, I will discuss the 
 pervasive challenges of efficiency\, expressiveness\, and scalability in t
 his research area\; my approach to addressing these challenges\; and futur

 : Service Abstractions for Scalable Deep Learning Inference at the Edge\n
 \nAdvisor: Wenjun Hu\n\nOther committee members:\n\nLin Zhong\nJames Aspn
 es\nMahadev Satyanarayanan (Carnegie Mellon University)\n\nAbstract:\n\nDe
 ep learning driven intelligent edge has already become a reality\, where m
 illions of mobile\, wearable\, and IoT devices analyze real-time data and 
 transform those into actionable insights on-device. Typical approaches for
  optimizing deep learning inference mostly focus on accelerating the execu
 tion of individual inference tasks\, without considering the contextual c
 orrelation unique to edge environments and the statistical nature of learn
 ing-based computation. Specifically\, they treat inference workloads as in
 dividual black boxes and apply canonical system optimization techniques\, 
 developed over the last few decades\, to handle them as yet another type o
 f computation-intensive applications. As a result\, deep learning inferenc
 e on edge devices still face the ever increasing challenges of customizati
 on to edge device heterogeneity\, fuzzy computation redundancy between inf
 erence tasks\, and end-to-end deployment at scale.\n\nIn this thesis\, we
  propose the first framework that automates and scales the end-to-end proc
 ess of deploying efficient deep learning inference from the cloud to heter
 ogeneous edge devices. The framework consists of a series of service abstr
 actions that handle DNN model tailoring\, model indexing and query\, and c
 omputation reuse for runtime inference respectively. Together\, these serv
 ices bridge the gap between deep learning training and inference\, elimina
 te computation redundancy during inference execution\, and further lower t
 he barrier for deep learning algorithm and system co-optimization.\n\nTo b
 uild efficient and scalable services\, we take a unique algorithmic approa
 ch of harnessing the semantic correlation between the learning-based compu
 tation. Rather than viewing individual tasks as isolated black boxes\, we 
 optimize them collectively in a white box approach\, proposing primitives 
 to formulate the semantics of the deep learning workloads\, algorithms to 
 assess their hidden correlation (in terms of the input data\, the neural n
 etwork models\, and the deployment trials) and merge common processing ste
 ps to minimize redundancy.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation

 i Nissim\, Georgetown University\n\nTitle: Legal theorems of privacy\n\n\n
 \n\nHost: Nisheeth Vishnoi\n\nAbstract:\n\nThere are significant gaps betw
 een legal and technical thinking around data privacy. Technical standards 
 of privacy are described using mathematical language and strive for mathem
 atical rigor whereas legal standards are not rigorous from a mathematical 
 point of view and the concepts underlying them are only partially defined.
  As a result\, arguments about the adequacy of technical privacy measures 
 for satisfying legal privacy often lack rigor\, and their conclusions are 
 uncertain. We ask whether it is possible to introduce mathematical rigor i
 nto such analyses so as to “prove” claims that technical privacy measu
 res meet legal expectations. We explore some of the gaps between legal and
  technical approaches to privacy and present initial strategies towards br
 idging these gaps.\n\nAs a particular example\, we focus on the concept of
  singling out from the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). T
 o capture this concept\, we define a new type of privacy attack\, predicat
 e singling out\, where an adversary finds a predicate matching exactly one
  row in a database with probability significantly better than a statistica
 l baseline. We then argue that any data release mechanism that purports to
  “render anonymous” data under the GDPR should prevent predicate singl
 ing out. Hence\, the concept has legal consequences as it can be used as a
  yardstick for arguing whether data release mechanisms meet the GDPR stand
 ard of data anonymization.\n\n\n\nBased on joint work with Micah Altman\, 
 Aloni Cohen\, and Alex Wood.\n\n\n\nBio:\n\n\n\nProf. Kobbi Nissim is a Mc
 Devitt Chair at the department of Computer Science\, Georgetown University

 hematical formulation and understanding of privacy. His work from 2003 and
  2004 with Dinur and Dwork initiated rigorous foundational research of pri
 vacy and in 2006 he introduced differential privacy with Dwork\, McSherry 
 and Smith. Nissim was awarded the Caspar Bowden Privacy for research in Pr

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nArman Cohan\n\nTitle: Adapt
 ing Transformer models for Document-level Natural Language Tasks\n\nHost: 
 Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nTransformer models have been extremely effe
 ctive at producing word- and sentence-level contextualized representations
 \, achieving state-of-the-art results in many Natural Language Processing 
 (NLP) tasks. However\, extending these models to document-level NLP tasks 
 faces challenges\, including lack of inter-document relatedness informatio
 n\, decreased performance in low-resource settings\, and computational ine
 fficiency when scaling to long documents.\n\nIn this talk\, I will describ
 e a few of my recent works on developing Transformer-based models that tar
 get document-level natural language tasks. I will first introduce SPECTER\
 , a method for producing document representations using a Transformer mode
 l that incorporates document-level relatedness signals and achieves state-
 of-the-art results in multiple document-level tasks in the scientific doma
 in.  Second\, I will describe TLDR\, the task of extreme summarization fo
 r scientific papers as well as CATTs\, a simple yet effective training str
 ategy for generating summaries in low-resource settings. Next\, I will dis
 cuss the practical challenges of scaling existing Transformer models to lo
 ng documents\, and our proposed solution\, Longformer. Longformer\, introd
 uces a new sparse self-attention pattern that scales linearly with the inp
 ut length while capturing both local and global context in the document\, 
 achieving state-of-the-art results in both character-level language modeli
 ng and document NLP tasks. Finally\, I’ll discuss CDLM\, our newly propo
 sed general pre-trained model for addressing multi-document tasks.\n\nBio:

 m of information and communication and will be the next frontier in comput

 ser\, significantly promoting the possibility and efficiency of informatio
 n access for many users besides data experts. All consumer-facing software
  will one day have a dialogue interface\, the next vital leap in the evolu
 tion of search engines. Such intelligent dialogue systems should be able t
 o understand the meaning of language grounded in various contexts and gene
 rate effective language responses in different forms for information reque
 sts and human-computer communication. In particular\, this dissertation fo
 cuses on answering the following three questions: 1) How can NLI ground hu
 man requests in natural language into formal programs (e.g.\, SQL)? 2) How
  can NLI converse with humans in a robust manner? 3) How can neural models

 n\nHost: Zhong Shao\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn recent years\, cryptocurrencies and
  blockchains have received widespread attention. These systems are general
 ly designed to be decentralized in order to reduce the required trust assu
 mptions as much as possible. However\, there are choices to be made about 
 how much to trust and how much to decentralize which in turn greatly affec
 t the properties that can be achieved efficiently.\n\nIn this talk\, I wil
 l discuss how these choices can be leveraged for large performance gains a
 nd to achieve new properties in smart contract systems and for privacy-pre
 serving cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nIn particular\, I will show how sm
 art contract scalability can be improved by executing contracts in smaller
  committees\, while at the same time allowing safe interaction between unt
 rusted contracts. Further\, I will show how lightweight blockchain clients
  for fully anonymous cryptocurrencies can be enabled efficiently\, and how
  privacy and accountability can be balanced in central bank digital curren
 cies.\n\nBio:\n\nKarl Wüst is a PhD Candidate in the System Security Grou

 itle: The Manifold of Neural Responses Informs Physiological Circuits in M
 ouse Visual System\n\nAdvisor: Steven Zucker\n\nOther committee members:\n
 \nJulie Dorsey\nRonald Coifman\nMichael Stryker (UCSF)\n\nAbstract:\n\nInf
 erring the structure and function of neural circuits is central to underst
 anding biological visual systems. Focusing on the visual system of the mou
 se\, we address two major challenges toward this goal. First\, we introduc
 e a novel stimulus ensemble. We show that it is rich enough to exercise th
 e visual system broadly but simple enough for analysis.  The ensemble inc
 ludes flow patterns\, a class of naturalistic visual stimuli that span spa
 tial frequency\, contrast\, orientation and directionality\, as well as co
 nventional grating stimuli. These flow stimuli are more constrained than n
 atural images but more variable than gratings and noise patterns. A stimul
 us generator is developed\, and it has been deployed in several neuroscien
 ce laboratories.\n\nThe second challenge is how to infer the functional st
 ructure of neural circuits from their activity to the stimulus ensemble. W
 e use machine learning techniques to develop a novel manifold of neurons. 
 This manifold is informative of basic circuit topology as well as neural f
 unction. It differs from the standard approach in which trials are embedde
 d in ‘neural coordinates.’ Our manifold\, by contrast\, embeds neurons
  in functional coordinates derived from the stimuli. It is defined so that
  those neurons that are close to one another on the manifold respond simil
 arly in both activity and time to similar features within the stimulus ens
 emble.\n\nPreliminary experiments with mouse retina and visual cortex data
  reveal examples of these different manifold structures and provide a foun
 dation for understanding the computational transition between retina and c
 ortex in awake\, behaving mice. The same algorithm can be applied to artif
 icial neural networks as well\; interestingly\, deep CNNs yield manifolds 
 that are disconnected like the retina\, not continuous like V1. For neuros
 cience\, this could explain the apparent ceiling in modeling cortical data
 \; the limitations of categorical tasks\; and suggests future modeling dir
 ections. More generally\, it illuminates limitations on the categorization
  problem\, and underlines the importance of recurrence in networks for mor
 e complex tasks.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-luc

 loped computer vision methods that enable robots to detect and track their
  teammates in real-world environments. Most group perception methods emplo
 y fixed\, overhead cameras (i.e.\, an exo-centric / third-person perspecti
 ve) to sense groups of people\, rendering them impractical for mobile robo
 ts working in most settings. I have developed a group detection and tracki
 ng system designed for ego-centric (i.e.\, first-person) perspective sensi
 ng\, which is more suitable for mobile robots\, to enable them to enter an
 y environment and accomplish their goals without external sensing requirem
 ents.\n\nNext\, I will discuss this work contextualized within a real-worl
 d application: human-robot teaming in healthcare. I am developing systems 
 for hospital Emergency Departments (ED)\, where frontline healthcare worke
 rs have been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. I will describe my work
  characterizing ED care delivery and staff workflow to enable robots to op
 erate in these challenging environments. Building on this\, I designed a s
 ocial navigation system that enables robots to incorporate the severity of
  patients’ health while navigating in the ED\, to prevent interruptions 
 in care delivery. My work will enable robots to work in safety-critical\, 
 human-centered environments\, and ultimately help improve patient outcomes
  and alleviate clinician workload.\n\nBio:\n\nAngelique Taylor is a Ph.D.

 tizing Computation and Analyst Resources in Large-scale Data Analytics\n\n
 Host: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nAbstract:\n\nData volumes are growing expo
 nentially\, fueled by an increased number of automated processes such as s
 ensors and devices. Meanwhile\, the computational power available for proc
 essing this data – as well as analysts’ ability to interpret it – re
 main limited. As a result\, database systems must evolve to address these 
 new bottlenecks in analytics. In my work\, I ask: how can we adapt classic
  ideas from database query processing to modern compute- and analyst-limit
 ed data analytics?\n\nIn this talk\, I will discuss the potential for this
  kind of systems development through the lens of several practical systems
  I have developed. By drawing insights from database query optimization\, 
 such as pushing workload- and domain-specific filtering\, aggregation\, an
 d sampling into core analytics workflows\, we can dramatically improve the
  efficiency of analytics at scale. I will illustrate these ideas by focusi
 ng on two systems — one designed to optimize visualizations for streamin
 g infrastructure and application telemetry and one designed for high-volum
 e seismic waveform analysis — both of which have been field-tested at sc
 ale. I will also discuss lessons from production deployments at companies 
 including Datadog\, Microsoft\, Google and Facebook.\n\nBio:\n\nKexin Rong
  is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University\, co-advise

 ilds systems to enable data analytics at scale\, supporting applications i
 ncluding scientific analysis\, infrastructure monitoring\, and analytical

 hitecting Quantum Computing Systems in the Presence of Noise\n\nHost: Lin 
 Zhong\n\nAbstract:\n\nQuantum computers may solve some problems beyond the
  reach of classical digital computers. However\, emerging quantum systems 
 are typically noisy and difficult to control\, leaving a significant gap b
 etween the exacting requirements of quantum applications and the realities
  of noisy devices. Bridging this gap is crucial – my work adapts convent
 ional computer systems techniques to meet the critical theoretical and exp
 erimental constraints in quantum processors. I divide my talk into three p
 arts: (i) introducing my recent work on systematic noise mitigation for su
 perconducting transmon qubits [MICRO’20]\, which enhances the robustness
  of quantum processors through coordination of control instructions\; (ii)
  demonstrating efficient and reliable quantum memory management [ISCA’20
 ]\, which implements automated tools for allocation\, reclamation and reus
 e of qubits in quantum programs\, much like in garbage collection for clas
 sical programs\; (iii) discussing on-going work on implementing quasi-faul
 t-tolerant rotation gates in quantum error correction\, which seeks to pro
 vide correctness guarantees for quantum applications by encoding quantum b
 its in a way that errors can be detected and corrected\, analogous to clas
 sical error-correcting codes.\n\nBio:\n\nYongshan Ding is a Ph.D. candidat
 e at the University of Chicago advised by Fred Chong. He received his B.Sc
 . degrees in computer science and physics from Carnegie Mellon University.
  His research focuses on quantum computer systems\, specifically through c
 o-design of quantum algorithms\, software\, and devices. Ding has develope
 d novel techniques for quantum error correction\, quantum memory managemen
 t\, and optimizations at the quantum-classical interface. His work has bee

 Building secure distributed systems atop the insecure Internet\n\nHost: An
 urag Khandelwal\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed systems are increasingly impor
 tant for our everyday life\, allowing for high performance\, fault toleran
 ce\, and flexibility. Many of these systems nowadays rely on the inherentl
 y insecure Internet infrastructure. Surely though\, they should have been 
 designed to take this into account…?\n\nIn this talk\, I will answer neg
 atively to this question using a concrete example: public blockchain syste
 ms such as Bitcoin. These are novel distributed systems that are designed 
 according to stringent failure models. In this context\, I will explain ho
 w an adversary controlling pieces of Internet infrastructure can practical
 ly compromise: (i) Bitcoin’s consensus protocol (by partitioning the net
 work)\; (ii) Bitcoin’s anonymity guarantees (by mapping pseudonyms to re
 al-world identities)\; and (iii) Bitcoin’s availability (by eclipsing cl
 ients).\n\nWhile these attacks are worrying\, I will also introduce practi
 cal and effective defenses to counter them both at the network and the app
 lication layer. Beyond Bitcoin\, this work teaches essential lessons for d
 istributed-system design.\n\nBio:\n\nMaria Apostolaki is a PhD Student at 
 ETH Zurich advised by Laurent Vanbever.\nDuring her studies\, she has been
  a visiting student at MIT (2019) and a research intern at Microsoft Resea
 rch (2018) and Google (2017). Before joining ETH\, she earned her diploma 
 in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical Universit
 y of Athens\, Greece.\n\nHer research focuses on building secure\, perform
 ant\, and deployable networked systems using both hardware and software. H
 er research led to discovering significant vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin 
 system and spearheaded changes to the Bitcoin codebase. Maria’s work rec
 eived widespread media coverage and was awarded an Applied Networking Rese
 arch Prize by IETF.\n\n*Contact\nAlicia\nor\nNancy\nfor Zoom link and pass

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nJay P. Lim\n\nTitle: Memory
  Safety and Buffer Overflow Lecture\n\nHost: Holly Rushmeier\n\nAbstract:\
 n\nMemory safety is a concept of protecting the memory and data of program
 s. Because memory safety is closely related to the integrity of the data\,
  it is paramount for developing safe and secure software. Memory safety er
 rors can occur when an unallocated region of memory is accessed or when me
 mory is accessed using methods that cause undefined behaviors. In this lec
 ture\, we will discuss about the various causes and consequences of memory
  safety error as well as techniques to prevent them. We will then focus on
  a particular class of memory safety known as buffer overflow error and it
 s implication in data integrity.\n\nThis lecture is designed for students 
 who have some experiences in programming in C language. In particular\, kn
 owledge in the interactions between pointers\, arrays\, and dynamic alloca
 tion of memory is paramount for the lecture. Understanding the basics of s
 tack and heap memory region is recommended\, and usually taught in previou
 s lectures.\n\nBio:\n\nJay P. Lim is a seventh year Ph.D. Student at Rutge
 rs University advised by Professor Santosh Nagarakatte. His research focus
  is on developing techniques to verify and synthesizes safe and secure low
  level computer systems. Jay completed his undergraduate degree in Compute
 r Science and Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nJay i
 s passionate about teaching and he has been a TA and an instructor for var
 ious courses during his time in Ph.D. program including Computer Architect
 ure\, Programming Languages\, Compilers\, Computer Security\, and Discrete
  Math. He has been an instructor for both large undergraduate courses and 
 small graduate courses. One of his passions is to make learning interestin
 g and fun to engage the students. It is his happiness to see students enjo
 ying his classes.\n\n\n*Contact\nAlicia\nor\nNancy\nfor Zoom link and pass

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nRanjay Krishna\n\nTitle: Vi
 sual Intelligence from Human Learning\n\nHost: Marynel Vázquez\n\nAbstrac
 t:\n\nAt the core of human development is the ability to adapt to new\, pr
 eviously unseen stimuli. We comprehend new situations as a composition of 
 previously seen information and ask one another for clarification when we 
 encounter new concepts. Yet\, this ability to go beyond the confounds of t
 heir training data remains an open challenge for artificial intelligence a
 gents. My research designs visual intelligence to reason over new composit
 ions and acquire new concepts. My talk will explore these challenges and p
 resent the two following lines of work:\n\nFirst\, I will introduce scene 
 graphs\, a cognitively-grounded\, compositional visual representation. I w
 ill discuss how to integrate scene graphs into a variety of computer visio
 n tasks\, enabling models to generalize to novel compositions from a few t
 raining examples. Since our introduction of scene graphs\, the Computer Vi
 sion community has developed hundreds of scene graph models and utilized s
 cene graphs to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple core tasks
 \, including object localization\, captioning\, image generation\, questio
 n answering\, 3D understanding\, and spatio-temporal action recognition.\n
 \nSecond\, I will introduce a framework for socially situated learning. Th
 is framework pushes agents beyond traditional computer vision training par
 adigms and enables learning from human interactions in online social envir
 onments. I will showcase a real-world deployment of our agent\, which lear
 ned to acquire new visual concepts by asking people targeted questions on 
 social media. By interacting with over 230K people over 8 months\, our age
 nt learned to recognize hundreds of new concepts. This work demonstrates t
 he possibility for agents to adapt and self-improve in real-world social e
 nvironments.\n\nBio:\n\nRanjay Krishna is a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at St
 anford University\, where he is co-advised by Fei-Fei Li and Michael Berns
 tein. His research lies at the intersection of computer vision and human-c
 omputer interaction\; it draws on ideas from behavioral and social science
 s to improve visual intelligence. His work has been recognized by the Chri
 stofer Stephenson Memorial award\, as an Accell Innovation Scholar and by 
 two Brown Institute for Media Innovation grants. His work has also been fe
 atured in Forbes magazine and in a PBS NOVA documentary. During his Ph.D.\
 , he re-designed Stanford’s undergraduate Computer Vision course and cur
 rently also instructs the graduate Computer Vision course\, Stanford’s s
 econd largest course. He received an M.Sc. from Stanford University. Befor
 e that\, he conferred a B.Sc. with a double major in Electrical Engineerin
 g and in Computer Science from Cornell University. In the past\, he has in
 terned at Google AI\, Facebook AI Research\, and Yahoo Research.\n\n*Conta

 ware is everywhere\, and almost everywhere\, software is broken. Some bugs
  just crash your printer\; others hand an identity thief your bank account

 programming languages techniques and systems design. First\, I’ll talk a
 bout securing massive\, security-critical codebases without clean slate re
 writes. This means rooting out hard-to-find bugs—as in Sys\, which scale
 s symbolic execution to find exploitable bugs in systems like the twenty-m

 y vulnerable pieces of code—as in VeRA\, which automatically verifies pa
 rt of the Firefox JavaScript engine. Finally\, I’ll discuss work on stro

 compiler infrastructure for program verification\, cryptographic proofs\, 
 optimization problems\, and more.\n\nBio:\n\nFraser Brown is a PhD student

  Learning through Interaction in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems\n\nHost: 
 Marynel Vázquez\n\nAbstract:\n\nEffective communication is an important s
 kill for enabling information exchange and cooperation in multi-agent syst
 ems\, in which agents coexist in shared environments with humans and/or ot
 her artificial agents.  Indeed\, human domain experts can be a highly inf
 ormative source of instructive guidance and feedback (supervision).  My p
 rior work explores this type of interaction in depth\, as a mechanism for 
 enabling learning for artificial agents.  However\, dependence upon human
  partners for acquiring or adapting skills has important limitations.  Hu
 man time and cognitive load is typically constrained (particularly in real
 istic settings) and data collection from humans\, though potentially quali
 tatively rich\, can be slow and costly to acquire. Yet\, the ability to le
 arn through interaction with other agents represents another powerful mech
 anism for enabling interactive learning.  Though other artificial agents 
 may\nalso\nbe novices\, agents can co-learn through providing each other e
 valuative feedback (reinforcement)\, given the learning task has been suff
 iciently structured and allows for generalization to novel settings.\n\nTh
 is talk presents research that investigates methods for enabling agents to
  learn\ngeneral\ncommunication skills through interactions with\nother age
 nts\n.  In particular\, the talk will focus on my ongoing work within Mul
 ti-Agent Reinforcement Learning\, investigating\nemergent\ncommunication p
 rotocols\, inspired by communication in real-world problem settings.  We 
 present a novel problem setting and a general approach that allows for zer
 o-shot coordination (ZSC)\, i.e.\, discovering protocols that can generali
 ze to independently trained agents.  We also explore and analyze specific
  difficulties associated with finding globally optimal ZSC protocols\, as 
 complexity of the communication task increases or the modality for communi
 cation changes (\ne.g.\nto implicit communication through physical movemen
 t\, by a simulated robotic agent).  Overall\, this work opens up exciting
  avenues for learning\ngeneral\ncommunication protocols in complex domains
 .\n\nBio:\n\nKalesha Bullard is a postdoctoral researcher at Facebook AI R
 esearch.  She completed her PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Institute 
 of Technology in 2019\, where her research focused within the space of int
 eractive robot learning.  During her postdoc\, Kalesha has expanded her r
 esearch to explore the space of multi-agent reinforcement learning\, curre
 ntly investigating how to enable embodied multi-agent populations to learn
 \ngeneral\ncommunication protocols.  More broadly\, Kalesha’s research 
 interests span autonomous reasoning and decision making for artificial age
 nts in multi-agent settings.  To date\, her research has focused on princ
 ipled methods for enabling agents to learn through interaction with other 
 agents (human or artificial) to achieve shared goals. Beyond research\, Ka
 lesha has participated in a number of service roles throughout her researc
 h career\, recently serving on organizing and program committees for works
 hops associated with several top Artificial Intelligence conference venues
  (NeurIPS\, AAAI\, AAMAS).  This past year\, she was selected as one of t
