DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nDr. Margaret Martonosi\nAs
 sistant Director for Computer and information Science and Engineering (CIS
 E)\nUS National Science Foundation\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe National Science Fo
 undation (NSF) supports a majority of US academic research in the Computer
  and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) topic areas.  Since Febru
 ary\, 2020\, Dr. Margaret Martonosi serves as NSF CISE AD\, stewarding t
 he CISE directorate’s $1B annual budget on behalf of research\, educatio
 n\, workforce and infrastructure funding in CISE topic areas and for scien
 ce as a whole.  Martonosi is conducting a series of “virtual campus v
 isits” to engage in conversation about a vision for CISE research going 
 forward\, and to field Q&A from the CISE community.  Please join us for t
 his highly-interactive session and please bring your input and questions!\
 n\nBio:\n\nMargaret Martonosi is the US National Science Foundation’s 
 (NSF) Assistant Director for Computer and information Science and Engineer
 ing (CISE). With an annual budget of more than $1B\, the CISE directorate 
 at NSF has the mission to uphold the Nation’s leadership in scientific d
 iscovery and engineering innovation through its support of fundamental res
 earch and education in computer and information science and engineering as
  well as transformative advances in research cyberinfrastructure. While at
  NSF\, Dr. Martonosi is on leave from Princeton University where she is 
 the Hugh Trumbull Adams ‘35 Professor of Computer Science. Dr. Martonos
 i’s research interests are in computer architecture and hardware-softwa
 re interface issues in both classical and quantum computing systems. Dr. 
 Martonosi is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Amer
 ican Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is a Fellow of the Association for 
 Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
 Engineers (IEEE).\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-dr-margar

SUMMARY:Dissertation Defense - Christopher Harshaw

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nChristopher Harshaw\
 n\nTitle: Algorithmic Advances for the Design and Analysis of Randomized 
 Experiments\n\nAdvisors: Daniel Spielman and Amin Karbasi\n\nOther commit
 tee members:\nSekhar Tatikonda\nFredrik Sävje\n\nAbstract:\n\nRandomized 
 experiments are the gold standard for establishing the causal effect of a 
 treatment on a population. In this dissertation\, I present algorithmic ad
 vances for three different problems arising in the design and analysis of 
 randomized experiments: covariate balancing\, variance estimation\, and bi
 partite experiments.\n\nIn the first part of the defense\, we describe an 
 inherent trade-off between covariate balancing and robustness\, which is t
 hen formulated as a distributional discrepancy problem. In order to navig
 ate this trade-off\, we present the Gram–Schmidt Walk Design which is ba
 sed on the recent discrepancy algorithm of Bansal\, Dadush\, Garg\, and Lo
 vett (2019). By tightening the algorithmic analysis\, we derive bounds on 
 the mean squared error of the Horvitz–Thompson estimator under this desi
 gn in terms of a ridge regression of the outcomes on the covariates\, whic
 h we interpret as regression by design. We carry out further analysis incl
 uding tail bounds on the effect estimator\, methods for constructing confi
 dence intervals\, and a kernel method extension of the design which accomm
 odates non-linear responses.\n\nIn the second part of the dense\, we study
  the problem of estimating the variance of treatment effect estimators und
 er interference. It is well-known that due to the fundamental problem of c
 ausal inference\, unbiased variance estimation is impossible without stron
 g assumption on the outcomes. Thus\, we study a class of conservative esti
 mators which are based on variance bounds. We identify conditions under wh
 ich the variance bounds themselves are admissible and provide a general al
 gorithmic framework to construct admissible variance bounds\, according to
  the experimenter’s preferences and prior substantive knowledge.\n\nTime
  permitting\, we will present methodology for the newly proposed bipartite
  experimental framework\, where units which receive treatment are distinct
  from units on which outcomes are measured\, and the two are connected via
  a bipartite graph. We propose the Exposure Re-weighted Linear (ERL) estim
 ator which we show is unbiased in finite samples and consistent and asympt
 otically normal in large samples provided the bipartite graph is sufficien
 tly sparse. We provide an variance estimator which facilitates confidence 
 intervals based on the normal approximation. Finally\, we present Exposure
 -Design\, a correlation clustering based design for improving precision of
  the ERL estimator.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-
