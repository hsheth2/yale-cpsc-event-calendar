 o Software Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nGo is a statically-typed programming la
 nguage that aims to provide a simple\, efficient\, and safe way to impleme
 nt concurrent programs. To achieve its design purpose\, Go recommends pass
 ing messages through channels as a less error-prone means of thread commun
 ication and also provides several new concurrency mechanisms and libraries
  to ease multi-threading programming. Since its creation in 2009\, Go has 
 become increasingly popular and has already been adopted to build many imp
 ortant software infrastructures. Unfortunately\, Go concurrency bugs\, esp
 ecially those due to misuse of channels\, still exist widely\, severely hu
 rting the reliability of Go software systems.\n\nIn this talk\, I will pre
 sent our recent research work on fighting Go concurrency bugs. We first em
 pirically studied 171 concurrency bugs from six famous\, open-source Go so
 ftware\, including Docker\, Kubernetes\, and gRPC to compare message passi
 ng and shared memory concurrency. Inspired by the study\, we then built a 
 static concurrency bug detection system\, GCatch\, to effectively identify
  block bugs due to misuse of channels. To avoid fundamental limitations of
  static analysis and capture more concurrency bugs\, we further designed a
  dynamic detection system\, GFuzz. Both GCatch and GFuzz pinpointed hundre
 ds of previously unknown concurrency bugs from famous Go software. Many of
  those detected bugs have already been fixed by programmers based on our r
 eporting.\n\nBio:\n\nLinhai Song is an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylv

 itle: Robots that Tutor in Complex and Dynamic Environments\n\nAdvisor: Br
 ian Scassellati\n\nOther committee members:\n\nMarynel Vázquez\nJulian Ja
 ra-Ettinger\nTony Belpaeme (Ghent University)\n\nAbstract:\n\nRobots have 
 shown great promise in being effective tutors for both children and adults
 . They have been shown to be successful in a variety of domains\, includin
 g math tutoring for children\, interruptions training for adults with Auti
 sm Spectrum Disorder\, and assisting the elderly while exercising. Despite
  the great potential of tutoring robots\, most studies have focused on pro
 viding short-term tutoring either in a laboratory or a school while the re
 searcher is present. For robots to be more broadly successful\, users need
  to be able to practice skills on a more prolonged basis. This requires ro
 botic systems to tutor in unstructured settings\, such as in homes and sch
 ools. Furthermore\, robots need to autonomously model the user and provide
  personalized help without needing a researcher’s presence.\n\nIn this d
 issertation\, we investigate several aspects of how to create robots that 
 can autonomously tutor in complex and dynamic environments. Our work start
 s by expanding the types of tasks that robots can train. Current robotic s
 ystems mainly focus on simple tasks. We present two algorithms that allow 
 robots to tutor more complex tasks: C-BKT and BKT-POMDP. C-BKT enables a s
 ystem to model a user’s skills over time\, providing opportunities for a
  robot to offer earlier personalized help actions compared to prior soluti
 ons. BKT-POMDP provides a policy for which task to give users to test thei
 r skills and which task should be chosen to maximize teaching when there a
 re multiple skills per task. Throughout the dissertation\, we provide exam
 ples of how we modeled complex tasks\, including electronic circuits\, soc
 ial skills\, and exercise forms.\n\nIn sequence\, we investigate which rob
 ot characteristics allow for successful tutoring. We explore how the role 
 of a robot influences the interaction when tutoring adults. We compare a r
 obot that takes on the role of a peer to taking on the role of a tradition
 al instructor. Our work provides evidence that a peer robot increases lear
 ning for a subset of the population and that it is generally viewed more f
 avorably than an instructor robot. We also investigated how robots indirec
 tly influence those around them by showing that robots can cause conformit
 y. People are willing to rely on information provided by robots when they 
 are unsure of the answer themselves. We also show that robots cause peer p
 ressure on participants.\n\nFinally\, we demonstrate two long-term systems
  where peer robots operated autonomously in participants’ homes. We show
  that robots successfully tutored and influenced participants in their hom
 es while maintaining engagement. In the first system\, a robot provided ad
 ults with motivation and coaching while doing dumbbell exercises. We show 
 that an embodied robot is more effective than the same robot shown in a vi
 deo on a tablet screen. In the second system\, we built a robotic system t
 hat provided dyadic tutoring to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and
  their caregivers. The robot engaged the user in social skills training vi
 a interactive games. Our clinical measures show that the robot increased c
 hildren’s social skills during the 30-day robotic intervention.\n\n\nhtt
