 y synthesis\nor algorithms to design policies for computational systems is
  one of the fundamental problems in computer science. Standing on the shou
 lders of simplified yet concise\ntask-specification\nusing high-level logi
 cal specification languages\, this talk will cover synthesis algorithms us
 ing two contrasting approaches. First\, the classical logic-based approach
  of reactive synthesis\; Second\, the modern learning-based approach of re
 inforcement learning. This talk will cover our scalable and efficient stat
 e-of-the-art algorithms for synthesis from high-level specifications using
  both these approaches\, and investigate whether formal guarantees are pos
 sible. We will conclude with a forward-looking view of these contributions
  to trustworthy AI.\n\nBio:\n\nSuguman Bansal\nis an NSF/CRA Computing Inn

 tle: Deep Learning for Embedding and Integrating Multimodal Biomedical Dat
 a\n\nAdvisor\n:\nSmita Krishnaswamy\n\nOther committee members:\n\nRonald 
 Coifman\nVladimir Rokhlin\n\nAbstract:\n\nBiomedical data is being generat
 ed in extremely high throughput and high dimension by technologies in area
 s ranging from single-cell genomics\, proteomics\, and transcriptomics (cy
 tometry\, single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing) to neuroscience and cogniti
 on (fMRI and PET) to pharmaceuticals (drug perturbations and interactions)
 . These new and emerging technologies and the datasets they create give an
  unprecedented view into the workings of their respective biological entit
 ies. However\, there is a large gap between the information contained in t
 hese datasets and the insights that current machine learning methods can e
 xtract from them.\n\nThis is especially the case when multiple technologie
 s can measure the same underlying biological entity or system. By separate
 ly analyzing the same system but from different views gathered by differen
 t data modalities\, patterns are left unobserved if they only emerge from 
 the multi-dimensional joint representation of all of the modalities togeth
 er. Through an interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes active collabora
 tion with data domain experts\, my research has developed models for \\tex
 tbf{data integration}\, extracting important insights through the joint an
 alysis of varied data sources.\n\nIn this thesis\, I discuss models that a
 ddress this task of multi-modal data integration\, especially generative a
 dversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs). My research has been fo
 cused on using both of these models in a generative way for concrete probl
 ems in cutting-edge scientific applications rather than the exclusive focu
 s on the generation of high-resolution natural images. The research in thi
 s thesis is united around ideas of building models that can extract new kn
 owledge from scientific data inaccessible to currently existing methods.\n

 late strong assumptions such as: (1) access to data that adequately captur

 Title: Automated Approaches for Program Verification and Repair\n\nAdviso
 r\n:\nRuzica Piskac\n\nOther committee members:\nZhong Shao\nAbhishek Bhat
 tacharjee\nNate Foster (Cornell University)\n\nAbstract:\n\nFormal methods
  techniques such as verification\, analysis\, and synthesis allow programm
 ers to prove properties of their programs\, or automatically derive progra
 ms from specifications. This dissertation presents automated analysis and 
 synthesis techniques to ease the debugging of modular verification systems
 \, allow easy access to constraint solvers from functional code\, and to r
 educe the burden of network administrators writing and analyzing firewalls
 .\n\nWe describe the design and implementation of a symbolic execution eng
 ine\, G2\, for non-strict functional languages such as Haskell. We then ex
 tended G2 to assist with modular verification. Modular verifiers allow pro
 grammers to write and prove specifications of their code. When a modular v
 erifier fails to verify a program\, it could be because of an actual bug i
 n the program\, but it could also be because a specification somewhere in 
 the program is too weak. We present a technique\, counterfactual symbolic 
 execution\, to aid in the debugging of both types of modular verification 
 failures\, by finding counterexample or counterexample-like explanations o
 f the failure. Further\, a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGI
 S) loop based technique is introduced to fully automate modular verificati
 on\, by using found counterexamples to automatically infer needed function
  specifications. The counterfactual symbolic execution and automated speci
 fication inference techniques are evaluated on existing LiquidHaskell erro
 rs and programs.\n\nIn addition to leveraging G2 to explain modular verifi
 cation errors\, we built a library\, G2Q\, which makes it easy for Haskell
  programmers to call G2 to solve constraint problem written in Haskell. G2
 Q uses symbolic execution to unroll recursive function definitions\, and g
 uarantees that the use of G2Q constraints will preserve type correctness.\
 n\nFinally\, we describe techniques to ease analysis and repair of firewal
 ls. Firewalls are widely deployed to manage network security. However\, fi
 rewall systems provide only a primitive interface\, in which the specifica
 tion is given as an ordered list of rules. This makes it hard to manually 
 track and maintain the behavior of a firewall. We introduce a formal seman
 tics for iptables firewall rules via a translation to first-order logic wi
 th uninterpreted functions and linear integer arithmetic\, which allows en
 coding of firewalls into a decidable logic. We then describe techniques to
  automate the analysis and repair of firewalls using SMT solvers\, based o
 n user provided specifications of the desired behavior. We evaluate this a
 pproach with real world case studies collected from StackOverflow users.\n

 heory\n\nAbstract:\n\nDeep learning models are quickly becoming an integra
 l part of a plethora of high stakes applications\, including autonomous dr
 iving and health care.  As the discovery of vulnerabilities and flaws in 
 these models has become frequent\, so has the interest in ensuring their s
 afety\, robustness and reliability.  My research addresses this need by i
 ntroducing new core methods and systems that can establish desirable mathe
 matical guarantees of deep learning models.\n\nIn the first part of my tal
 k I will describe how we leverage abstract interpretation to scale verific
 ation to orders of magnitude larger deep neural networks than prior work\,
  at the same time demonstrating the correctness of significantly more prop
 erties.  I will then show how these techniques can be extended to ensure\
 , for the first time\, formal guarantees of probabilistic semantic specifi
 cations using generative models.\n\nIn the second part\, I will show how t
 o fuse abstract interpretation with the training phase so as to improve a 
 model’s amenability to certification\, allowing us to guarantee orders o
 f magnitude more properties than possible with prior work.  Finally\, I w
 ill discuss exciting theoretical advances which address fundamental questi
 ons on the very existence of certified deep learning.\n\nBio:\n\nMatthew M

 m via covariance inequalities\n\nAbstract:\n\nCaffarelli’s contraction 
 theorem states that the optimal transport map from the standard Gaussian t
 o an α-strongly log-concave measure is α^{-1/2}-Lipschitz. This is a pow
 erful result because the existence of a Lipschitz transport map allows one
  to transfer a number of functional inequalities (e.g. Poincaré inequalit
 y\, log-Sobolev inequality\, isoperimetric inequalities…) from the sourc
 e measure to the target measure. However\, the current proofs of this theo
 rem (e.g. Caffarelli’s original PDE argument\, or the argument of Fathi\
 , Gozlan\, and Prodhomme via entropic regularization) are somewhat diffic
 ult. Recently\, Lipschitz transport maps were constructed in other ways (v
 ia the Follmer process and via the reverse heat flow)\, but it is still of
  central importance to understand the optimal transport map.\n\nIn this ta
 lk\, I give a short proof of Caffarelli’s contraction theorem via covar
 iance inequalities. This is joint work with Aram-Alexandre Pooladian from 
 NYU.\n\nBio:\n\nSinho Chewi is a fourth year PhD student in the Department

 n-robot collaboration\n\nAbstract\n\nAs our expectations for robots’ ada
 ptive capacities grow\, it will be increasingly important for\nthem to rea
 son about the novel objects\, tasks\, and interactions inherent to everyda
 y life. Rather\nthan attempt to pre-train a robot for all potential task v
 ariations it may encounter\, we can\ndevelop more capable and robust robot
 s by assuming they will inevitably encounter situations\nthat they are ini
 tially unprepared to address. My work enables a robot to address these nov
 el\nsituations by learning from a human teacher’s domain knowledge of th
 e task\, such as the\ncontextual use of an object or tool. Meeting this ch
 allenge requires robots to be flexible not only\nto novelty\, but to diffe
 rent forms of novelty and their varying effects on the robot’s task\ncom
 pletion. In this talk\, I will focus on (1) the implications of novelty\, 
 and its various causes\, on\nthe robot’s learning goals\, (2) methods fo
 r structuring its interaction with the human teacher in\norder to meet tho

 \nTitle: Learning 3D representations with minimal supervision\n\nAbstract:
 \n\nDeep learning has demonstrated considerable success embedding images a
 nd more general 2D representations into compact feature spaces for downstr
 eam tasks like recognition\, registration\, and generation. Learning on 3D
  data\, however\, is the missing piece needed for embodied agents to perce
 ive their surrounding environments. To bridge the gap between 3D perceptio
 n and robotic intelligence\, my present efforts focus on learning 3D repre
 sentations with minimal supervision.\n\nIn this talk\, I will discuss two 
 key aspects to reduce the amount of human supervision in current 3D deep l
 earning algorithms. First\, I will talk about how to recover structures fr
 om 3D data such as point clouds and incorporate such inductive bias into p
 oint cloud learning pipelines. Second\, I will present our works on levera
 ging natural supervision in point clouds to perform self-supervised learni
 ng. In addition\, I will discuss how these 3D learning algorithms enable h
 uman-level perception for robotic applications such as self-driving cars.
   Finally\, the talk will conclude with a discussion about future inquiri

 s\n\nAbstract\n\nSystems that support expressive\, situated natural langua
 ge interactions are essential for expanding access to complex computing sy
 stems\, such as robots and databases\, to non-experts. Reasoning and learn
 ing in such natural language interactions is a challenging open problem. F
 or example\, resolving sentence meaning requires reasoning not only about 
 word meaning\, but also about the interaction context\, including the hist
 ory of the interaction and the situated environment. In addition\, the seq
 uential dynamics that arise between user and system in and across interact
 ions make learning from static data\, i.e.\, supervised data\, both challe
 nging and ineffective. However\, these same interaction dynamics result in
  ample opportunities for learning from implicit and explicit feedback that
  arises naturally in the interaction. This lays the foundation for systems
  that continually learn\, improve\, and adapt their language use through i
 nteraction\, without additional annotation effort. In this talk\, I will f
 ocus on these challenges and opportunities. First\, I will describe our wo
 rk on modeling dependencies between language meaning and interaction conte
 xt when mapping natural language in interaction to executable code. In the
  second part of the talk\, I will describe our work on language understand
 ing and generation in collaborative environments\, focusing on continual l
 earning from explicit and implicit user feedback.\n\nBio\n\nAlane Suhr is

 n\nAbstract:\n\nLarge-scale deep learning models have become the foundatio
 n of today’s natural language processing (NLP). Despite their recent\, t
 remendous success\, they struggle with generalization in real-world settin
 gs\, like their predecessors. Besides\, their sheer scale brings new chall
 enges—the increasing computational cost heightens the barriers to entry 
 to NLP research.\n\nThe first part of the talk will discuss innovations in
  neural architectures that can help address the efficiency concerns of tod
 ay’s NLP. I will present algorithms that reduce state-of-the-art NLP mod
 els’ overhead from quadratic to linear in input lengths without hurting 
 accuracy. Second\, I will turn to inductive biases grounded in the inheren
 t structure of natural language sentences\, which can help machine learnin
 g models generalize. I will discuss the integration of discrete\, symbolic
  structure prediction into modern deep learning.\n\nI will conclude with f

 \n\nTitle: Machine learning for equitable healthcare\n\nAbstract:\n\nAdvan
 ces in machine learning and the explosion of clinical data have demonstrat
 ed immense potential to fundamentally improve clinical care and deepen our
  understanding of human health. However\, algorithms for medical intervent
 ions and scientific discovery in heterogeneous patient populations are par
 ticularly challenged by the complexities of healthcare data. Not only are 
 clinical data noisy\, missing\, and irregularly sampled\, but questions of
  equity and fairness also raise grave concerns and create additional compu
 tational challenges.\n\nIn this talk\, I present two approaches for levera
 ging machine learning towards equitable healthcare. First\, I demonstrate 
 how to adapt disease progression modeling to account for differences in ac
 cess to care. Using a deep generative model\, we can correct for patient m
 isalignment in disease onset time to learn more clinically useful disease 
 subtypes. Second\, I examine how to address algorithmic bias in supervised
  learning for cost-based metrics discimination. By decomposing discriminat
 ion into bias\, variance\, and noise components\, I propose tailored actio
 ns for estimating and reducing each term of the total dscimination. The ta
 lk concludes with a discussion about how to rethink the entire machine lea
 rning pipeline with an ethical lens to building algorithms that serve the 
 entire patient population.\n\nBio:\n\nIrene Chen is a PhD student in the C

 oftware Dynamics\n\nAbstract\n\nFrom mobile and cloud apps to video games 
 to driverless vehicle control\, more and more software is time-constrained
 : it must deliver reliable results seamlessly\, consistently\, and virtual
 ly instantaneously. If it doesn’t\, customers are unhappy–and sometime
 s lives are put at risk. When complex software underperforms or fails\, id
 entifying the root causes is difficult and\, historically\, few tools have
  been available to help\, leaving application developers to guess what mig
 ht be happening. How can we do better?\n\nThe key is to have low-overhead 
 observation tools that can show exactly where all the  elapsed time goes 
 in both normal responses and in delayed responses. Doing so makes visible 
 each of the seven possible reasons for such delays\, as we show.\n\nBio\n\
