DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAbhishek Bhattacharjee\nDep
 artment of Computer Science\, Yale University\n\nTitle: Computer Architect
 ures for Mind-Machine Teaming\n\nAbstract:\n\nDirect brain-computer commun
 ication promises to help treat neurological disorders\, explain brain func
 tion\, and augment human cognition and decision-making. The promise of min
 d-machine teaming hinges on computer systems that delicately balance the t
 ight power\, latency\, and bandwidth trade-offs needed to decode brain act
 ivity\, stimulate biological neurons\, and control assistive devices most 
 effectively.\n\nThis talk presents the design of two systems that unlock s
 everal brain-computer interactions while navigating the power and performa
 nce trade-offs posed by brain interfacing. The first system\, HALO\, is an
  accelerator-rich processing fabric that enables flexible single-brain-sit
 e interfacing at high data rates using only tens of milliwatts of power. T
 he second system\, Hull\, realizes multi-brain-site interfacing using a di
 stributed system of networked accelerator-rich processing fabrics built at
 op HALO. Driven by important brain-computer interface applications (e.g.\,
  epilepsy\, movement disorders\, paralysis)\, we explore systems research 
 questions pertaining to the design and integration of hardware accelerator
 s\, co-design of hardware accelerators with networking & storage stacks\, 
 and clean interfaces/abstractions for programmability. Key insights are un
 dergirded via chip tape-outs in a 12nm CMOS process.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yal

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Ajay Rayasam\, Osage University Partners
DTSTART:20230127T170000
DTEND:20230127T180000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nIntro to Venture Capital â€“ (aka VC101)\n
 - Intended for new entrepreneurs\, VC101 has educated many university rese
 archers during the past few years on how venture capital works.\n\nThis se
 minar will help you understand venture capital with respect to entrepreneu
 rship. The seminar will explore these questions:\n\n\nDoes your newco have
  what it takes to secure VC financing?\n\nWho is investing in academic sta
 rtups?\n\nWhat technology sectors are most likely to get funded?\n\nHow sh
 ould you and your colleagues approach potential investors?\n\nWhen should 
 you seek funding from non-dilutive sources\, family and friends\, angels\,
  crowdfunding?\n\nWho should be the CEO?\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/even
