DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe dates for the Joint Boards of Permanen
 t Officers (JBPO) have been scheduled for the 2020-21 academic year.  Ple
 ase reserve:\n\nThursday\, October 29\, 2020\n\nThursday\, December 10\, 2
 020\n\nThursday\, February 25\, 2021\n\nThursday\, April 15\, 2021\n\nThur
 sday\, May 13\, 2021\n\nAll meetings start at 4:00 p.m. and will be via Zo
 om for the foreseeable future. Two weeks prior to each meeting\, an email 
 will be sent with the link to preregister for the meeting\, along with the
  CONFIDENTIAL agenda and supporting materials. After preregistering you wi
 ll receive a confirmation email containing the Zoom link to join the meeti
 ng.\n\nIn order to ensure a quorum*\, please attend if you are able\, espe
 cially if you are a designated quorum officer of your department or progra
 m.\n\n*Voting in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers. Full professors w
 hose primary or fully joint appointments are in a Faculty of Arts and Scie
 nces department may vote\, as may full professors of professional schools 
 with secondary appointments in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department a
 nd explicit Corporation approval for such voting rights. The only exceptio
 n to this rule is for faculty in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry who
  are assigned to vote in the School of Medicine’s Board of Permanent Off
 icers and may not also vote in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers of Y
 ale College and the Graduate School. By long standing custom\, a quorum fo
 r the conduct of business at a meeting of the Joint Boards consists of 37 
 members eligible to vote. No vote has force if the number of votes\, plus 
 recorded abstentions\, falls short of that number. Tenure appointments are
  forwarded to the Corporation only upon an affirmative vote by two-thirds 
 of the members present and eligible to vote. All other appointments are ap
 proved by majority vote. (Faculty Handbook\, Section IV.F.5)\n\nYale Unive

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Theodore Kim\, Yale University

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\n\nSpeaker: Theodore Kim\, Y
 ale University\n\nTitle: A Racial History of CGI In Film\n\nAbstract:\n\nT
 he algorithms used for Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) in film today were
  developed over the course of the last 45 years. In the beginning\, they c
 ould only depict a limited set of visual phenomena\, which filmmakers took
  up as a creative challenge. These early efforts resulted in some of the m
 ost memorable images in cinema\, from\nToy Story\nto\nTerminator 2: Judgem
 ent Day\n. However\, as these CGI gained more attention and attracted more
  money\, the insidious effects of systemic racism crept into the design of
  subsequent algorithms. As a result\, the techniques for rendering digital
  “humans” we use today were specifically designed to depict the domina
 nt visual features of young\, white people. In this talk\, I will describe
  how we got here\, what it might mean\, and where we can go next.\n\nBio:\
 n\nTheodore Kim is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Yale Univ
 ersity\, where he investigates biomechanical solids\, fluid dynamics\, and
  selected topics in geometry. Previously\, he was a Senior Research Scient
 ist at Pixar Animation Studios. He is the recipient of the NSF CAREER Awar
 d\, multiple Best Paper awards\, and a Scientific and Technical Academy Aw
 ard (SciTech Oscar). His first (uncredited) work appeared on-screen on the
  Sorting Hat in\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\n.\n\n\nhttps://c

SUMMARY:CS Distinguished Colloquium - Hayley Iben\, Pixar

 d Kim\n\nAbstract:\n\nHair simulation in animated feature films presents m
 any challenges\, ranging from incorporating artistic control to dealing wi
 th extreme\, non-physical character motion. In a production environment\, 
 hair simulation needs to be fast\, stable\, and usable without excessive p
 arameter tuning in order to produce content efficiently. These challenges 
 only increase when simulating a variety of hair styles on numerous charact
 ers in the film. In this talk I will present our method for stably simulat
 ing stylized hair that addresses these artistic needs and performance dema
 nds. In addition to the underlying hair model that defines the physical mo
 tion\, I will discuss various artistic controls and approaches used to pro
 duce our final hair simulations in several feature films.\n\nBio:\n\nHayle
 y Iben is the Director of Engineering for Applications in the Software R&D
  department at Pixar Animation Studios. Her teams are responsible for film
  production technologies for sets\, layout\, characters\, shading\, crowds
 \, animation\, simulation\, lighting and rendering. Prior to undertaking t
 his role\, Hayley led the engineering team responsible for character simul
 ation technologies\, including cloth\, hair\, flesh\, and skin\, for seven
  of her fourteen years at the studio. Hayley’s expertise is in hair simu
 lation and she has been developing the studio’s hair technology\, Taz\, 
 that debuted in Disney Pixar’s “Brave”. She has also built tools for
  character articulation and animation\, focusing on inverse kinematics and
  mathematical techniques. Hayley earned a B.S. in computer science from Du
 quesne University and a M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Univer
 sity of California\, Berkeley.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-disting
