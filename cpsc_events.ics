DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium/YINS\n(This is
  a joint event with YINS)\n\nChristos Papdimitriou\n\, Columbia University
 \n\nTitle: “Language\, Brain\, and Computation”\n\nZoom link:\nhttps:/
 /yale.zoom.us/j/9274859808\n\nHost: Yang Cai\n\nAbstract:\n\nHow does the 
 brain beget the mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapses effect reaso
 ning\, intelligence\, language?   Despite dazzling progress in experimen
 tal neuroscience\, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of
  scale\, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question 
 – the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required.  
 As Richard Axel recently put it:  “We don’t have a logic for the tran
 sformation of neural activity into thought […].”\n\nWhat kind of forma
 l system would qualify as this “logic”?\n\nI will introduce a computat
 ional system whose basic data structure is the assembly – assemblies are
  large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\, thoughts\, e
 tc. –\, and which is informed by recent progress in understanding how la
 nguage happens in the brain.\n\nBio:\n\nChristos Harilaos Papadimitriou is
  the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.
   Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor at UC Berkeley for
  the previous 22 years\, and before that he taught at Harvard\, MIT\, NTU 
 Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five textbooks and many art
 icles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applications to optimizatio
 n\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics and game theory\, the 
 Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a PhD from Princeton (197
 6)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member of the National Acade
 my of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and
  the National Academy of Engineering\, and he has received the Knuth prize
 \, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as well as the 2018 Harvey
  Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the Hellenic republic named
  him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He has also written three no
 vels: “Turing \,” “Logicomix”  and his latest “Independence.”

SUMMARY:CS Distinguished Colloquium - Eva Tardos\, Cornell University
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201023T200000

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium\n\nÉva Tardos
 \, Cornell University\n\nTitle: Selfish Learning in Queueing Systems\n\nHo
 st: Yang Cai\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/92748598082\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nOver the last two decades we have developed good understanding how to
  quantify the impact of strategic user behavior on overall performance in 
 many games (including traffic routing as well as online auctions)\, and sh
 owed that the resulting bounds extend to repeated games assuming players u
 se a form of no-regret learning that helps them adapt to the environment.
   Unfortunately these results do not apply when outcomes in one iteration
  effect the game in the future\, which is typically the case in applicatio
 ns. In this talk we will study this phenomenon in the context of a game mo
 deling queuing systems: routers compete for servers\, where packets that d
 o not get service will be resent at future rounds\, resulting in a system 
 where the number of packets at each round depends on the success of the ro
 uters in the previous rounds. In joint work with Jason Gaitonde\, we analy
 ze the resulting highly dependent random process and find that if the capa
 city of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeabl
 e scheduler to get all packets served even with double the packet arrival 
 rate\, then learning can help the queues in coordinating their behavior\, 
 the expected number of packets in the queues will remain bounded throughou
 t time\, assuming older packets have priority.\n\nBio:\n\nÉva Tardos is
  a Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Computer Science\, currently chair of
  the Department of Computer Science for a second term after being chair 20
 06-2010. She was Interim Dean for Computing and Information Sciences 2012-
 2013 and more recently was Associate Dean for Diversity & Inclusion at Cor
 nell University. She received her BA and PhD from Eötvös University in B
 udapest. She joined the faculty at Cornell in 1989. Tardos’s research i
 nterest is algorithms and interface of algorithms and incentives.  She is
  most known for her work on network-flow algorithms and quantifying the ef
 ficiency of selfish routing. She has been elected to the National Academy 
 of Engineering\, the National Academy of Sciences\, the American Philosoph
 ical Society\, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and to the Hung
 arian Academy of Sciences. She is the recipient of a number of fellowships
  and awards including the Packard Fellowship\, the Gödel Prize\, Dantzig 
 Prize\, Fulkerson Prize\, ETACS prize\, and the IEEE von Neumann Medal. Sh
 e co-wrote the widely used textbook\nAlgorithms Design\n. She is editor ed
 itor-in-Chief of the Journal of the ACM\, has been editor-in-Chief of SIAM
  Journal of Computing\, and editor of several other journals\, and was pro
 gram committee member and chair for several ACM and IEEE conferences in he
 r area.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-distinguished-colloquium-eva-t

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe dates for the Joint Boards of Permanen
 t Officers (JBPO) have been scheduled for the 2020-21 academic year.  Ple
 ase reserve:\n\nThursday\, October 29\, 2020\n\nThursday\, December 10\, 2
 020\n\nThursday\, February 25\, 2021\n\nThursday\, April 15\, 2021\n\nThur
 sday\, May 13\, 2021\n\nAll meetings start at 4:00 p.m. and will be via Zo
 om for the foreseeable future. Two weeks prior to each meeting\, an email 
 will be sent with the link to preregister for the meeting\, along with the
  CONFIDENTIAL agenda and supporting materials. After preregistering you wi
 ll receive a confirmation email containing the Zoom link to join the meeti
 ng.\n\nIn order to ensure a quorum*\, please attend if you are able\, espe
 cially if you are a designated quorum officer of your department or progra
 m.\n\n*Voting in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers. Full professors w
 hose primary or fully joint appointments are in a Faculty of Arts and Scie
 nces department may vote\, as may full professors of professional schools 
 with secondary appointments in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department a
 nd explicit Corporation approval for such voting rights. The only exceptio
 n to this rule is for faculty in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry who
  are assigned to vote in the School of Medicine’s Board of Permanent Off
 icers and may not also vote in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers of Y
 ale College and the Graduate School. By long standing custom\, a quorum fo
 r the conduct of business at a meeting of the Joint Boards consists of 37 
 members eligible to vote. No vote has force if the number of votes\, plus 
 recorded abstentions\, falls short of that number. Tenure appointments are
  forwarded to the Corporation only upon an affirmative vote by two-thirds 
 of the members present and eligible to vote. All other appointments are ap
 proved by majority vote. (Faculty Handbook\, Section IV.F.5)\n\nYale Unive
