  using Machine Learning and Multipath\nNetwork Protocol\n\nAbstract:\n\nRe
 search interest has been significantly emerged in streaming 360◦ videos 
 over the Internet to provide an immersive experience to the users. A major
  challenge of streaming such videos is that the amount of video data to be
  streamed could be an order of magnitude larger than conventional videos t
 o achieve a similar viewing experience. The reason for this is that conven
 tional streaming solutions fetch the entire panoramic scene\, while the us
 er views only a small part of the scene depending on his/her viewing direc
 tion in 360◦ videos.\n\nIn this talk\, I will present my research on adv
 ancing the user quality of experience (QoE) on 360◦ video streaming usin
 g deep learning techniques and network protocol innovations. In the first 
 part of the talk\, I propose a system called Mosaic\, which utilizes deep 
 learning techniques to predict user’s viewing direction and uses a knaps
 ack-based rate adaptation algorithm such that it maximizes the user-percei
 ved video bitrates given available network capacity. In Mosaic+\, I furthe
 r improve the user QoE by utilizing a more representative metric of QoE as
  opposed to only the bitrates as in Mosaic.\n\nIn the second part of the t
 alk\, I will present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based adaptive  stream
 ing framework\, called ATRIA\, which further improves the adaptiveness to 
 the network and user behaviors by exploiting the sequential decision-makin
 g nature of video streaming techniques. I will share how I address the cha
 llenges of using RL in this scenario\, such as large action space and dela
 yed reward evaluation.\n\nIn the last part of this talk\, I will address t
 he limited bandwidth issue by aggregating multiple network paths and using
  related transport layer innovations. With an early promise of my work tha
 t viewport prediction and rate adaptation work well for videos not used fo
 r training\, I will conclude by describing avenues for future work\, inclu
 ding improving the QoE of applications that offer immersive user experienc
 e with omnidirectional 360° images\, unlocking the other bandwidth-hungry
  delay-sensitive applications to Machine Learning and Network Innovations.

 ance-Reduced Gradient Methods\n\nAbstract:\n\nPlug-and-play (PnP) methods 
 have recently emerged as a powerful framework for image reconstruction tha
 t can flexibly combine different physics-based observation models with dat
 a-driven image priors in the form of denoisers\, and achieve state-of-the-
 art image reconstruction quality in many applications. In this work\, we a
 im to further improve the computational efficacy of PnP methods by designi
 ng a new algorithm that makes use of stochastic variance-reduced gradients
  (SVRG)\, a nascent idea to accelerate runtime in stochastic optimization.
  Compared with existing PnP methods using batch gradients or stochastic gr
 adients\, the new algorithm\, called PnP-SVRG\, achieves comparable or bet
 ter accuracy of image reconstruction at a much faster computational speed.
  Extensive numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the benefits 
 of the proposed algorithm through the application of phase retrieval in co
 njunction with a wide variety of popular image denoisers.\n\nBio:\n\nVince
 nt Monardo is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering D
 epartment at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. Yuejie Chi. Vincent
  received his BSE with Honors in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State
  University with a Minor in Applied Mathematics. Vincent’s research inte
 rests lie in the domain of designing and analyzing efficient algorithms fo
 r solving inverse problems–especially within the realm of image reconstr
 uction–which improve upon the computational and statistical performance 
 of state-of-the-art methods. In the future\, Vincent is motivated to teach
  future generations the beauty of machine learning–in 2019\, he received
  the CMU ECE Outstanding Teaching Award. In his spare time\, Vincent enjoy
 s trivia\, crosswords\, music\, and rock climbing.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.
