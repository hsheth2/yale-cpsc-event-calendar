 ium\nSpeaker:\nSuresh Venkatsubramanian\n\, Professor in the School of Com
 puting at University of Utah\n\nTitle: Critical Algorithm Studies - A View
  From Inside Computer Science\n\nHost:\nElisa Celis\n\nAbstract: The brigh
 t spotlight on bias in algorithmic decision making has surfaced an older a
 nd deeper idea - that technology embeds values\, and without understanding
  what those values are\, we cannot talk about what we want from algorithmi
 c systems. This critical take on algorithmic systems has long been the pur
 view of thinkers in the social sciences. But what would such a stance look
  like from the purview of the computer scientists building systems? And ho
 w might we reframe the design of systems to be more responsive to the valu
 es we want them to have?\n\nIn this talk I’ll talk about two examples of
  attempting to “flip the script” and reframe algorithmic design questi
 ons from the perspective of subjects of a system rather than the system de
 signers\, with an overriding goal being to design systems that remove barr
 iers to access rather than reinforcing them. I’ll look at access in (soc
 ial) networks as well as access to important societal resources\, and in b
 oth cases show how this reorientation leads to new modes of inquiry and ne
 w ways to assess disparities.\n\nSpeaker Biography: Suresh Venkatasubraman
 ian is a professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. H
 is background is in algorithms and data science and he is particularly int
 erested in the social ramifications of automated decision making. He is a 
 co-founder of the FAccT conference\, a member of the board at the ACLU of 
 Utah\, and a member of the Computing Community Consortium Council. His wor
 k has received press coverage across North America and Europe\, including 
 NPR’s Science Friday\, NBC\, and CNN. Suresh received his B.Tech from II
 T Kanpur and his PhD from Stanford.\n\nhttps://computationsociety.yale.edu

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe dates for the Joint Boards of Permanen
 t Officers (JBPO) have been scheduled for the 2020-21 academic year.  Ple
 ase reserve:\n\nThursday\, April 15\, 2021\n\nThursday\, May 13\, 2021\n\n
 All meetings start at 4:00 p.m. and will be via Zoom for the foreseeable f

 nk to preregister for the meeting\, along with the CONFIDENTIAL agenda and
  supporting materials. After preregistering you will receive a confirmatio
 n email containing the Zoom link to join the meeting.\n\nIn order to ensur
 e a quorum*\, please attend if you are able\, especially if you are a desi
 gnated quorum officer of your department or program.\n\n*Voting in the Joi
 nt Boards of Permanent Officers. Full professors whose primary or fully jo
 int appointments are in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department may vote
 \, as may full professors of professional schools with secondary appointme
 nts in a Faculty of Arts and Sciences department and explicit Corporation 
 approval for such voting rights. The only exception to this rule is for fa
 culty in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry who are assigned to vote in
  the School of Medicine’s Board of Permanent Officers and may not also v
 ote in the Joint Boards of Permanent Officers of Yale College and the Grad
 uate School. By long standing custom\, a quorum for the conduct of busines
 s at a meeting of the Joint Boards consists of 37 members eligible to vote
 . No vote has force if the number of votes\, plus recorded abstentions\, f
 alls short of that number. Tenure appointments are forwarded to the Corpor
 ation only upon an affirmative vote by two-thirds of the members present a
 nd eligible to vote. All other appointments are approved by majority vote.
