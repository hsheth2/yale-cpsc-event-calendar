DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium\n\nSpeaker: Ha
 yley Iben\, Pixar\n\nTitle: Simulating Hair for Animated Films\n\nHost: Te
 d Kim\n\nAbstract:\n\nHair simulation in animated feature films presents m
 any challenges\, ranging from incorporating artistic control to dealing wi
 th extreme\, non-physical character motion. In a production environment\, 
 hair simulation needs to be fast\, stable\, and usable without excessive p
 arameter tuning in order to produce content efficiently. These challenges 
 only increase when simulating a variety of hair styles on numerous charact
 ers in the film. In this talk I will present our method for stably simulat
 ing stylized hair that addresses these artistic needs and performance dema
 nds. In addition to the underlying hair model that defines the physical mo
 tion\, I will discuss various artistic controls and approaches used to pro
 duce our final hair simulations in several feature films.\n\nBio:\n\nHayle
 y Iben is the Director of Engineering for Applications in the Software R&D
  department at Pixar Animation Studios. Her teams are responsible for film
  production technologies for sets\, layout\, characters\, shading\, crowds
 \, animation\, simulation\, lighting and rendering. Prior to undertaking t
 his role\, Hayley led the engineering team responsible for character simul
 ation technologies\, including cloth\, hair\, flesh\, and skin\, for seven
  of her fourteen years at the studio. Hayley’s expertise is in hair simu
 lation and she has been developing the studio’s hair technology\, Taz\, 
 that debuted in Disney Pixar’s “Brave”. She has also built tools for
  character articulation and animation\, focusing on inverse kinematics and
  mathematical techniques. Hayley earned a B.S. in computer science from Du
 quesne University and a M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Univer
 sity of California\, Berkeley.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-disting

 n\nZoom Link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/9857560888\n\nHost: Nisheeth VIshnoi
 \n\nAbstract:\n\nThe recent demonstration of quantum supremacy by Google i
 s a first step towards the era of small to medium scale quantum computers.
  In this talk I will explain what the experiment accomplished and the theo
 retical work it is based on\, as well as what it did not accomplish and th
 e many theoretical and practical challenges that remain. I will also descr
 ibe recent breakthroughs in the design of protocols for the testing and be
 nchmarking of quantum computers\, a task that has deep computational and p
 hilosophical implications. Specifically\, this leads to protocols for scal
 able and verifiable quantum supremacy\, certifiable quantum random generat
 ion and verification of quantum computation.\n\nThe talk will be aimed at 
 a broad CS and Physics audience.\n\nBio:\n\nUmesh Virkumar Vazirani is the
  Roger A. Strauch Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
  at the University of California\, Berkeley\, and the director of the Berk
 eley Quantum Computation Center. He is one of the pioneers of quantum comp
 utation\, and has worked on the computational foundations of randomness an
 d the theory of classical algorithms. Vazirani is member of the National A
 cademy of Science\, and the author of two books: An Introduction to Comput
 ational Learning Theory with Michael Kearns (MIT Press) and Algorithms wit
 h Sanjoy Dasgupta and Christos Papadimitriou (McGraw Hill)\n\nAbstrac\n\n\

SUMMARY:CS Distinguished Colloquium - Joel Emer\, MIT
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201204T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201204T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium\n\nSpeaker:\nJ
 oel Emer\, MIT\n\nHost: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nTitle: Data Orchestratio
 n is the New Compute: Computer Architecture for the Post-Moore Era\n\nHost
 : Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecent history is replete with my
 riad examples of new applications that have changed the course of computin
 g and the world. These include the spreadsheet\, visual editing\, graphics
 \, networking and many more. Behind each of these advances were programs d
 eveloped on easily-programmable and ever-faster processors. Unfortunately\
 , as is widely acknowledged\, the technological trend articulated by Moore
 ’s Law\, which contributed significantly to creating the “ever faster
 ” part of that recipe\, is dead (or at least slowing significantly). How
 ever\, as outlined in our “Science” article\, “There’s plenty of r
 oom at the top”\, there is promise in continuing Moore’s Law-like impr
 ovements through a multi-pronged approach that includes software performan
 ce engineering\, algorithm improvements and hardware architecture advances
 . Among those researchers focusing on the hardware architecture advances p
 rong\, there are many who advocate significant specialization of the hardw
 are to specific domains\, which will typically be well-understood and of w
 idely-acknowledged importance. This approach\, however\, is likely to impe
 de the development of the next big application because there will be no ge
 nerally-programmable platform on which to develop it. Therefore\, I believ
 e that the biggest challenge in evolving hardware architectures in the pos
 t-Moore era lies in striking the right balance between preserving broad pr
 ogammability and enhancing efficiency. In this talk\, I will discuss how w
 e have approached that challenge by focusing on the aspects of the hardwar
 e that gives the most leverage to improve efficiency and by providing an a
 bstraction that make it possible to compile to the new hardware.  More s
 pecifically\, since data movement has become the dominant consumer of ener
 gy\, I will describe structures that facilitate “data orchestration” t
 hat reduce and optimize data movement. I also will describe abstractions t
 hat are intended to made it possible to compile high-level programs to the
 se new hardware structures.\n\nBio:\n\nFor over 40 years\, Joel Emer held 
 various research and advanced development positions investigating processo
 r microarchitecture and developing performance modeling and evaluation tec
 hniques. He has made architectural contributions to a number of VAX\, Alph
 a and X86 processors and is recognized as one of the developers of the wid
 ely employed quantitative approach to processor performance evaluation. Mo
 re recently\, he has been recognized for his contributions in the advancem
 ent of deep learning accelerator design\, spatial and parallel architectur
 es\, processor reliability analysis\, cache organization and simultaneous 
 multithreading. Currently he is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology and spends part time as a Senior Distinguished Research Sci
 entist in Nvidia’s Architecture Research group. Previously\, he worked a
 t Intel where he was an Intel Fellow and Director of Microarchitecture Res
 earch.  Even earlier\, he worked at Compaq and Digital Equipment Corpora
 tion. He earned a doctorate in electrical engineering from the University 
 of Illinois in 1979. He received a bachelor’s degree with highest honors
  in electrical engineering in 1974\, and his master’s degree in 1975 –
  both from Purdue University. Recognitions of his contributions include an
  ACM/SIGARCH-IEEE-CS/TCCA Most Influential Paper Award for his work on sim
 ultaneous multithreading\, and six other papers that were selected as IEEE
  Micro’s Top Picks in Computer Architecture.  Among hisprofessional ho
 nors\, he is a Fellow of both the ACM and IEEE\, and a member of the NAE. 
 In 2009 he was recipient of the Eckert-Mauchly award for lifetime contribu
 tions in computer architecture.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-distin
