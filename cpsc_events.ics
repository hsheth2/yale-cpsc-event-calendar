 disjoint theories with shared predicates\n\nAbstract:\n\nMany approaches t
 o the analysis\, verification\, and synthesis of programs require automate
 d reasoning support in the form of decision procedures for satisfiability 
 modulo a combination of theories (SMT). The classical -Oppen scheme for th
 eory combination assumes that the theories are disjoint\, meaning they do 
 not share symbols other than equality. However\, it suffices to enrich the
  theory of arrays with a length function to make it share symbols with ano
 ther theory (e.g.\, linear arithmetic).\n\nIn this talk I present the CDSA
 T paradigm for theory combination and its extension to theories that share
  predicate symbols. CDSAT (Conflict-Driven Satisfiability) handles problem
 s with assignments to first-order variables (satisfiability modulo assignm
 ents)\, works by coordinating theory modules to reason in a conflict-drive
 n manner\, and subsumes the Nelson-Oppen scheme. The extension to shared p
 redicates requires only minimal changes\, and is exemplified for a theory 
 of arrays with extensionality and abstract length. The notion of abstract 
 length admits the traditional interpretation where a length is an integer 
 and the indices of an array form an interval\, but it has also other inter
 pretations. It is precisely this abstraction that makes it possible to sol
 ve the problem by sharing only one predicate symbol.\n\n(Joint work with S
 téphane Graham-Lengrand and Natarajan Shankar)\n\nBio:\n\nMaria Paola Bon

 ining Systems)\, and PxTP (Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving)\, among oth
 er events. She visited many research sites\, including LORIA Nancy\, Unive
 rsität Koblenz-Landau\, MPI Saarbrücken\, Tel Aviv University\, King’s
  College\, EPFL\, ETHZ\, Chalmers University of Technology\, and Universit
 é Paris XI Orsay\, in Europe\; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champ
 aign\, the University of Oregon\, the Argonne National Laboratory\, Stanfo
 rd University\, Iowa State University\, the University of Colorado at Denv
 er\, the University of Idaho\, and CUNY Graduate College\, in America\; th
 e Chinese Academy of Sciences\, East China Normal University\, Tsinghua Un
 iversity\, and National Taiwan University\, in Asia.\n\nShe organizes the 
 2021 and 2023 seminars on automated deduction at Schloss Dagstuhl\, and sh
 e chaired the Skolem Award Committee 2021. She serves regularly on the Pro
 gram Committee of IJCAR (International Joint Conference on Automated Reaso
 ning)\, CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction) for which she was also pr
 ogram chair\, and several other conferences. She was elected thrice to the
  Board of Trustees of CADE Inc.\, and twice President of the Board: in thi
 s capacity\, she chaired the committee that assigns the Herbrand Award\, a
 nd she instituted the CADE Best Paper and the Skolem (test of time) awards

SUMMARY:CS/YQI Colloquium - Jakub Szefer\, Yale University

 versity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Computer Cybersecurity\n\nAs Quantu
 m Computer device research continues to advance rapidly\, there are also a
 dvances at the other levels of the computer system stack that involve thes
 e devices. In particular\, more and more of the Quantum Computer devices a
 re becoming available as cloud-based services through IBM Quantum\, Amazon
  Braket\, Microsoft Azure\, and others. In parallel\, researchers have put
  forward ideas about multi-programming of the Quantum Computer devices whe
 re single device can be shared by multiple programs\, or even multiple use
 rs. While all of the advances make the Quantum Computer devices more easil
 y accessible and increase utilization\, they open up the devices to variou
 s security threats. Especially\, with cloud-based access and multi-tenancy
 \, different\, remove\, and untrusted users could abuse the Quantum Comput
 er devices to leak information from other users using the shared devices\,
  map or learn about the Quantum Computer infrastructure itself\, or even p
 ossibly try to damage the infrastructure or the devices. This talk will ai
 m to provide some background on security lessons that Computer Architectur
 e and Hardware Security community has learned from the past decades explor
 ing hardware-related security issues in classical computers. It will then 
 motivate the need to think about Quantum Computer cybersecurity now\, to m
 ake sure that security is first-class objective when designing and deployi
 ng these devices in cloud-based settings. The talk will then present recen
 t research on security attacks on Quantum Computer devices in IBM Quantum 
 cloud-based computers\, as well as preliminary developments of defensive t
 echniques. The end goal of the presentation is to motivate discussion abou
 t Quantum Computer Cybersecurity and make connections between the Quantum 
 Computer research community and the Hardware Security research community.\

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDissertation Defense\nZeyu Wang\n\nTitle: 
 Enhancing the Creative Process in Digital Prototyping\n\nAdvisor: Julie Do
 rsey\n\nOther Committee Members:\nHolly Rushmeier\nSteven Zucker\nLeonard 
 McMillan (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nDespite advances in computer-aided design (CAD) systems and video editing
  software\, digital content creation for design\, storytelling\, and inter
 active experiences remains a challenging problem. This dissertation introd
 uces a series of studies\, techniques\, and systems along three thrusts th
 at engage creators more directly and enhance the user experience in author
 ing digital content.\n\nFirst\, we present a drawing dataset and spatiotem
 poral analysis that provide insight into how people draw by comparing trac
 ing\, freehand drawing\, and computer-generated approximations. We found a
  high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used o
 ver time\, which informs methods for customized stroke treatment and emula
 ting drawing processes. We also propose a deep learning-based technique fo
 r line drawing synthesis from animated 3D models\, where our learned style
  space and optimization-based embedding enable the generation of line draw
 ing animations while allowing interactive user control across frames.\n\nS
 econd\, we demonstrate the importance of utilizing spatial context in the 
 creative process in augmented reality through two tablet-based interfaces.
  DistanciAR enables designers to create site-specific AR experiences for r
 emote environments using LiDAR capture and new authoring modes\, such as D
 ollhouse and Peek. PointShopAR integrates point cloud capture and editing 
 in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in th
 eir spatial context. Our user studies show that LiDAR capture and the poin
 t cloud representation in these systems can make rapid AR prototyping more
  accessible and versatile.\n\nLast\, we introduce two procedural methods t
 o generate time-based media for visual communication and storytelling. Ani
 Code supports authoring and on-the-fly consumption of personalized animati
 ons in a network-free environment via a printed code. CHER-Ob generates vi
 deo flythroughs for storytelling from annotated heterogeneous 2D and 3D da
 ta for cultural heritage. Our user studies show that these methods can ben
 efit the video-oriented digital prototyping experience and facilitate the 
 dissemination of creative and cultural ideas.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/e
