 celerating Scientific Discovery\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe dramatic increase in b
 oth sensor capabilities and computational power over the last few decades 
 has created enormous opportunities for using machine learning (ML) to enha
 nce scientific discovery. To realize this potential\, ML systems must seam
 lessly integrate with the key tools for scientific discovery. However\, di
 fficult problems stand in the way of this goal. For instance\, how can we 
 incorporate scientific domain knowledge within ML algorithms? How can we u
 se ML to quantify uncertainty in simulations? How can we use ML to plan ex
 periments under real-world budget constraints?\n\nFor the above questions\
 , I’ll first present the key computational and statistical challenges th
 rough the lens of probabilistic modeling. Next\, I’ll highlight limitati
 ons of existing approaches for scaling to high-dimensional data and presen
 t algorithms from my research that can effectively overcome these challeng
 es. These algorithms are theoretically principled\, domain-agnostic\, and 
 exhibit strong empirical performance. Notably\, I’ll describe a collabor
 ation with chemists and material scientists where we used these algorithms
  to optimize an experimental pipeline for electric batteries and significa
 ntly reduced the overall time costs from about 1.5 years to 16 days. Final
 ly\, I’ll conclude with an overview of future opportunities for using ML
  to accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nBio:\n\nAditya Grover is a fifth-y
 ear Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by 
 Stefano Ermon. His research focuses on learning and inference algorithms f
 or probabilistic models and is grounded in applications to accelerate phys
 ical sciences. Aditya’s research has been published in top scientific an
 d ML/AI venues (e.g.\, Nature\, NeurIPS\, ICML\, ICLR\, AAAI\, AISTATS)\, 
 included in popular open source ML software\, and deployed into production
  at major technology companies. His work has been recognized with a best p
 aper award (StarAI)\, a Lieberman Fellowship\, a Data Science Institute Sc
 holarship\, and a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship. He is also a Teachi
 ng Fellow at Stanford since 2018\, where he co-created and teaches a new c
 lass on Deep Generative Models. Previously\, Aditya obtained his bachelors
  in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Delhi in 2015\, where he rec
 eived a best undergraduate thesis award.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/

 arning Optimizations\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs an increasingly important workload
 \, machine learning (ML) applications require different performance optimi
 zation techniques from traditional runtimes and compilers. In particular\,
  to accelerate ML applications\, it is generally necessary to perform ML c
 omputations on heterogeneous hardware and parallelize computations using m
 ultiple data dimensions\, neither of which is even expressible in traditio
 nal compilers and runtimes. In this talk\, I will describe my work on auto
 mated discovery of performance optimizations to accelerate ML computations
 .\n\nTASO\, the Tensor Algebra SuperOptimizer\, optimizes the computation 
 graphs of deep neural networks (DNNs) by automatically generating potentia
 l graph optimizations and formally verifying their correctness. TASO outpe
 rforms rule-based graph optimizers in existing ML systems (e.g.\, TensorFl
 ow\, TensorRT\, and TVM) by up to 3x by automatically discovering novel gr
 aph optimizations\, while also requiring significantly less human effort.\
 n\nFlexFlow is a system for accelerating distributed DNN training. FlexFlo
 w identifies parallelization dimensions not considered in existing ML syst
 ems (e.g.\, TensorFlow and PyTorch) and automatically discovers fast paral
 lelization strategies for a specific parallel machine. Companies and natio
 nal labs are using FlexFlow to train production ML models that do not scal
 e well in current ML systems\, achieving over 10x performance improvement.
 \n\nI will also outline future research directions for further automating 
 ML systems\, such as codesigning ML models\, software systems\, and hardwa
 re backends for end-to-end ML deployment.\n\nBio:\n\nZhihao Jia is a Ph.D.
  candidate in the Computer Science department at Stanford University worki
 ng with Alex Aiken and Matei Zaharia. His research interests lie in the in
 tersection of computer systems and machine learning\, with a focus on buil
 ding efficient\, scalable\, and high-performance systems for ML computatio

 on Machine Learning: Algorithms\, Inference\, and Fairness\n\nAbstract:\n\
 nMachine learning plays a key role in shaping the decisions made by a grow
 ing number of institutions. This talk will share variational perspectives 
 on aspects of inference\, algorithms and fairness. On the topic of algorit
 hms\, I will present a variational framework on a classical family of conv
 ex optimization algorithm called accelerated gradient algorithms and demon
 strate how it leads to simpler\, faster gradient-based algorithms and gene
 ralizations of existing acceleration frameworks. On the topic of inference
 \, I will present a variational framework for developing computationally e
 fficient approximations of cross-validation and show how it provides fast 
 and reliable estimates of out-of-sample performance for many machine learn
 ing models. On the topic of fairness\, I will present a variational model 
 for reasoning about the long-term impacts of using machine learning models
  to allocate scarce resources and opportunities to people\, such as employ
 ment and educational decisions.\n\nBio:\n\nAshia Wilson is a postdoctoral 
 researcher in the Machine Learning Group at Microsoft Research\, New Engla
 nd. She received undergraduate degrees in Applied Mathematics and Philosop
 hy from Harvard University in 2011. She received her doctorate in Statisti
 cs from the University of California\, Berkeley in 2018 advised by Benjami
 n Recht and Michael I. Jordan. Her research interests are in providing rig
 orous guarantees for algorithmic performance\, and in developing framework
 s for studying issues of fairness and governance in machine learning.\n\n\

 \n\nAbstract:\n\nWe use language to refer to objects like “toast”\, 
 “plate”\, and “table” and to communicate requests such as “Could
  you make breakfast?” In this talk\, I will present work on computationa
 l methods to tie language to physical\, grounded meaning. Robots are an id
 eal platform for such work because they can perceive and interact with the
  world. I will discuss dialog and learning strategies I have developed to 
 enable robots to learn from their human partners\, similar to how people l
 earn from one another through interaction. I will present methods enabling
  robots to understand language referring expressions like “the heavy\, m
 etallic mug”\, the first work showing that it is possible to learn to co
 nnect words to their perceptual properties in the visual\, tactile\, and a
 uditory senses of a physical robot. I will also present benchmarks and mod
 els for translating high-level human language like “put the toast on the
  table” that imply latent\, intermediate goals into executable sequences
  of agent actions with the help of low-level\, step-by-step language instr
 uctions. Finally\, I will discuss how my work in grounded language contrib
 utes to NLP\, robotics\, and the broader goals of the AI community.\n\nBio

 ington working with Luke Zettlemoyer. He received his PhD from the Univers
 ity of Texas at Austin with Raymond Mooney. His research focuses on langua
 ge grounding and natural language processing applications for robotics (Ro
 boNLP). Key to this work is using dialog with humans to facilitate both ro
 bot task execution and learning to enable lifelong improvement of robots
 ’ language understanding capabilities. He has worked to encourage and pr
 omote work in RoboNLP through workshop organization at both NLP and roboti
 cs conference venues.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-colloquium-jesse

  Diagnosis for Distributed Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nDistributed software sy
 stems have become the backbone of Internet services. Consequently\, Failur
 es in production distributed systems have severe consequences. A 63-minute
  outage of Amazon in 2018 caused a 100-million loss in revenue. Moreover\,
  the frequency of failures rises with the increasing complexity of softwar
 e systems. 2019 has experienced noticeably more Internet outages and is so
 metimes considered as the “year of outages”.\n\nDiagnosing such failur
 es in distributed systems at data center scale is a particularly critical\
 , yet notoriously difficult task because these systems are complex: there 
 are numerous threads\, processes\, and nodes communicating concurrently. E
 xisting diagnosis techniques are either intrusive and incur non-negligible
  performance overhead in a production environment\, or face scalability ch
 allenges when applied to complex software systems.\n\nA promising approach
  is to replicate how developers diagnose these failures. Guided by this no
 tion\, this talk will describe two tools\, namely Pensieve and Kairux\, wh
 ich automate two major tasks of failure diagnosis: failure reproduction an
 d root cause localization. Given the logs and code of a distributed system
  that has failed (in production)\, Pensieve is capable of formulating a mi
 nimal set of operations necessary to reproduce the failure\, and Kairux ca
 n further pinpoint the single instruction that is the root cause.\n\nBio:\

 ty and availability of complex\, real-world systems.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc

 s Using Programmable Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe continuing increase of d
 ata center network bandwidth\, coupled with a slower improvement in CPU pe
 rformance\, has challenged our conventional wisdom regarding data center n
 etworks: how to build distributed systems that can keep up with the networ
 k speeds and are high-performant and energy-efficient? The recent emergenc
 e of a programmable network fabric (PNF) suggests a potential solution. By
  offloading suitable computations to a PNF device (i.e.\, SmartNIC\, recon
 figurable switch\, or network accelerator)\, one can reduce request servin
 g latency\, save end-host CPU cores\, and enable efficient traffic control
 .\n\nIn this talk\, I will present two frameworks for building PNF-enabled
  distributed systems: (1) IncBricks\, an in-network caching fabric built w
 ith network accelerators and programmable switches\; (2) iPipe\, an actor-
 based framework for offloading distributed applications on SmartNICs. I wi
 ll show how to make efficient use of in-network heterogeneous computing re
 sources by applying approximation techniques\, co-designing with end-host 
 software layers\, employing new programming abstractions\, and designing e
 fficient control-/data-planes. Finally\, I will discuss how to use PNF to 
 re-architect other data center systems.\n\nBio:\n\nMing Liu is a Ph.D. can
 didate in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at th
 e University of Washington\, advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy\, Luis Ceze\,
  and Simon Peter. His research interests are in computer systems and netwo
 rks\, with a focus on optimizing distributed systems by exploring the comp
 uting capabilities across the programmable network fabric (including Smart
 NICs\, reconfigurable switches\, and network accelerators).\n\n\nhttps://c
