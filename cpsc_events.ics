DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nComputation and Society Colloquium and Com
 puter Science Distinguished Speaker Series\n\nBernard Chazelle\n\, Eugene
  Higgins Professor of Computer Science\, Princeton\n\nTitle: Building an A
 lgorithmic Toolkit for Out-of-Equilibrium Systems\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://y
 ale.zoom.us/j/95783107535\n\nHost:\nNisheeth Vishnoi\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAlg
 orithms research has long been preoccupied with systems that reach equilib
 rium: random processes should converge to stationary distributions\; dynam
 ical systems should be attracting or\, at worst\, periodic\; algorithms sh
 ould terminate and land in a “good” place\; etc. Natural algorithms\, 
 those found in nature\, break all of these rules. What are we to do then? 
 Answer: Build new algorithmic tools. I will sketch some of my efforts in t
 hat direction. The talk will be aimed at a general scientific audience and
  will require no background knowledge.\n\n\n\nBio:\nBernard Chazelle (grad
 uate of École des Mines de Paris\, PhD Yale) has been professor at Prince
 ton University since 1986\, where he holds the Eugene Higgins chair in Com
 puter Science.\n\nAs Director of the NSF Center for Computational Intracta
 bility\, his research focuses on algorithms and complexity. He has been a 
 visiting professor at École Normale Supérieure (ENS) Ulm\, École Polyte
 chnique\, University of Paris-Sud\, and INRIA. He spent many years as a co
 nsultant for Xerox PARC\, DEC SRC\, NEC Research\, (where he chaired the B
 oard of Fellows) and Tsinghua University in Beijing. He is\, or was\, memb
 er of the Scientific Committee at ENS Ulm\, École Polytechnique\, and the
  Institut Henri Poincaré. He is also a member of the American Academy of 
 Arts and Sciences and the European Academy of Sciences\, ACM Fellow\, Gugg
 enheim Fellow\, and winner of several awards from the SIAM mathematical so
 ciety.\n\nA pioneering figure in computational geometry\, Bernard Chazelle
  is known for his resolution of a number of longstanding open questions in
  the field. His research has also led him to investigate the role of rando
 mness in computing\, a subject he took up in his book\, The Discrepancy Me
 thod: Randomness and Complexity. In the last few years\, his efforts have 
 focused on “natural algorithms\,” with the aim of building a bridge be
 tween dynamical systems and algorithms from the living world. Professor Ch
 azelle takes pride in having taught the very first “Integrated Science
 ” program at Princeton University\, together with colleagues from physic
 s and biology.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/computation-and-society-

 92748598082\n\nHost: Robert Soule\n\nRamana Kompella\, Cisco\nTitle: Resea
 rch topics of interest in emerging tech areas for Cisco\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn
  the past few months\, Cisco Research has started focusing on several emer
 ging technology areas of interest to Cisco. In this talk\, I will be talki
 ng a bit about  what these areas are of research interest are\, how we a
 re leveraging and engaging with universities for tech and societal impact.
 \n\nBio:\n\nDr. Ramana Kompella is currently the Head of Research in the E
 merging Technology and Incubation group at Cisco. His previous experience 
 includes co-founding successful startups\, and providing engineering leade
 rship to build world class products currently in use in several hundreds o
 f customers’ data centers. Prior to his industry roles\, he was a tenure
 d faculty at Purdue in Computer Science Department\, where he conducted re
 search on systems and networking areas\, with multi-million dollar grants 
 from NSF and other industry sources. He co-advised several PhD and Masters
  students\, and has co-authored 70+ publications in top networking and sys
 tems conferences such as SIGCOMM. He was the recipient of several awards i
 ncluding the prestigious NSF CAREER award.\n\nJohn Marshall\, Cisco\nTitle
 : Exploring the Potential of Edge Computing\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the growt
 h of end-points\, 5G mobility\, and volumes of data used for analytics\, e
 dge computing brings computation closer to where data is generated that al
 lows machine learning algorithms to provide faster response times and impr
 oved efficiency.  Local processing can also offer autonomous operation im
 proving availability and greater network utilization.\n\nThe benefits are 
 clear\; however\, the definition of the edge will continue to evolve to su
 pport the processing needs of the Internet of Things (IoT).  Architectura
 l trade-offs need to be considered which enables efficient distributed pro
 cessing to occur between IoT devices\, local edge servers\, and cloud comp
 uting resources.  The datacenter’s physical operating environment isn
 ’t able to be easily extended in terms of power delivery\, cooling needs
 \, or even physical space.  Simply using smaller compute units\, CPUs & G
 PUs\, is not sufficient.\n\nTomorrow’s edge computing environment needs 
 to support vastly improved power efficiency over a range of physical opera
 ting environments while enabling a common software-defined framework for o
 perational agility.  Applications will likely adapt to enable edge-comput
 e to augment IoT processing while maintaining data privacy & security.\n\n
 Bio:\n\nJohn Marshall is a Distinguished Engineer at Cisco Systems.  His 
 interest in network innovation includes programmable data planes\, network
  processor architecture\, and high-performance packet classification.  Hi
 s current focus is on the development of a next-generation Data Processing
  Unit (DPU) for edge computing.  John has held numerous silicon architect
 ural and design roles at Cisco involving the application advanced memory t
 echnologies.\n\nBefore joining Cisco\, he worked for IBM as a senior desig
 ner in disciplines that include network processors\, switch fabrics\, and 
 vector processing.  John holds over 25 patents in processor and system de
 sign.  He also has several publications in the areas of computer architec
 ture & networking.\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/cs-distinguished-collo

DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium/YINS\n(This is

 \n\nTitle: “Language\, Brain\, and Computation”\n\nZoom link:\nhttps:/
 /yale.zoom.us/j/9274859808\n\nHost: Yang Cai\n\nAbstract:\n\nHow does the 
 brain beget the mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapses effect reaso
 ning\, intelligence\, language?   Despite dazzling progress in experimen
 tal neuroscience\, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of
  scale\, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question 
 – the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required.  
 As Richard Axel recently put it:  “We don’t have a logic for the tran
 sformation of neural activity into thought […].”\n\nWhat kind of forma
 l system would qualify as this “logic”?\n\nI will introduce a computat
 ional system whose basic data structure is the assembly – assemblies are
  large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\, thoughts\, e
 tc. –\, and which is informed by recent progress in understanding how la
 nguage happens in the brain.\n\nBio:\n\nChristos Harilaos Papadimitriou is
  the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.
   Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor at UC Berkeley for
  the previous 22 years\, and before that he taught at Harvard\, MIT\, NTU 
 Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five textbooks and many art
 icles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applications to optimizatio
 n\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics and game theory\, the 
 Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a PhD from Princeton (197
 6)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member of the National Acade
 my of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and
  the National Academy of Engineering\, and he has received the Knuth prize
 \, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as well as the 2018 Harvey
  Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the Hellenic republic named
  him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He has also written three no
 vels: “Turing \,” “Logicomix”  and his latest “Independence.”

SUMMARY:CS Distinguished Colloquium - Eva Tardos\, Cornell University

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Distinguished Colloquium\n\nÉva Tardos
 \, Cornell University\n\nTitle: Selfish Learning in Queueing Systems\n\nHo
 st: Yang Cai\n\nZoom link:\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/j/92748598082\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nOver the last two decades we have developed good understanding how to
  quantify the impact of strategic user behavior on overall performance in 
 many games (including traffic routing as well as online auctions)\, and sh
 owed that the resulting bounds extend to repeated games assuming players u
 se a form of no-regret learning that helps them adapt to the environment.
   Unfortunately these results do not apply when outcomes in one iteration
  effect the game in the future\, which is typically the case in applicatio
 ns. In this talk we will study this phenomenon in the context of a game mo
 deling queuing systems: routers compete for servers\, where packets that d
 o not get service will be resent at future rounds\, resulting in a system 
 where the number of packets at each round depends on the success of the ro
 uters in the previous rounds. In joint work with Jason Gaitonde\, we analy
 ze the resulting highly dependent random process and find that if the capa
 city of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeabl
 e scheduler to get all packets served even with double the packet arrival 
 rate\, then learning can help the queues in coordinating their behavior\, 
 the expected number of packets in the queues will remain bounded throughou
 t time\, assuming older packets have priority.\n\nBio:\n\nÉva Tardos is
  a Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Computer Science\, currently chair of
  the Department of Computer Science for a second term after being chair 20

 udapest. She joined the faculty at Cornell in 1989. Tardos’s research i
 nterest is algorithms and interface of algorithms and incentives.  She is
  most known for her work on network-flow algorithms and quantifying the ef
 ficiency of selfish routing. She has been elected to the National Academy 
 of Engineering\, the National Academy of Sciences\, the American Philosoph
 ical Society\, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and to the Hung
 arian Academy of Sciences. She is the recipient of a number of fellowships
