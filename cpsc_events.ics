 tentative\n\nTitle: Privacy-preserving formal methods\n\nAdvisor: Ruzica P
 iskac\n\nOther Committee Members:\n\nTimos Antonopoulos\nClark Barrett (St
 anford University)\nDan Boneh (Stanford University)\nZhong Shao\n\nAbstrac
 t:\n\nSoftware and hardware can often exhibit undesirable behaviors\, whic
 h can lead to catastrophic consequences. Formal methods offer a vast colle
 ction of techniques to analyze and verify these systems mathematically to 
 ensure the correctness\, robustness\, and safety of software and hardware 
 systems against a specification.\n\nDespite the significant success of for
 mal method techniques\, privacy requirements are not being considered in t
 heir design. On the other hand\, formal methods are often used to verify t
 he critical components of systems\, which is frequently valuable intellect
 ual property. Furthermore\, the specification requirements are often impos
 ed by outside parties in some settings\, such as regulatory agencies or so
 ftware marketplaces\, entities that are not always trusted by the system o
 wners.\n\nMy study of designing efficient formal methods that retain a pro
 gram’s privacy is guided by these proprietary concerns. In this disserta
 tion\, I introduce a suite of privacy-preserving formal method techniques 
 I have designed:\n\n\nPrivacy-preserving SAT solving. The SAT problem is f
 inding an assignment of variables to make a Boolean formula evaluate to tr
 ue. As one of the most fundamental problems\, it is the core of many verif
 ication techniques with SMT solvers often being crucial components. This d
 issertation describes ppSAT: a privacy-preserving SAT solver that enables 
 two parties to decide whether the conjunction of their secret formulae is 
 satisfiable or not while maintaining the privacy of each party’s input f
 ormulae.\n\nRefutation proofs in zero knowledge.  Proving that a given Bo
 olean formula is unsatisfiable is critical in formal methods for illustrat
 ing the safety or robustness of a system\, and the existing state-of-the-a
 rt techniques utilize resolution proofs. This dissertation presents a zero
 -knowledge protocol for proving the unsatisfiability of Boolean formulae i
 n propositional logic. We encode the verification of a resolution proof us
 ing polynomial equivalence checking\, which enabled us to use a fast ZK pr
 otocol for verifying relations between polynomials.\n\nPrivacy-preserving 
 model checking for CTL formulae. Model checking is the problem of verifyin
 g whether an abstract model of a computational system meets a specificatio
 n of behavior given as a logic formula. This dissertation explains how to 
 apply secure multiparty computation (MPC) to model-checking algorithms to 
 maintain the privacy of both the model and the specification. Our approach
  adopts oblivious graph algorithms to allow for secure computation of glob
 al explicit state model checking with specifications written in Computatio
 n Tree Logic (CTL).\n\nPrivate regular expression pattern matching based o
 n NFA. Regular expression pattern matching is one of the fundamental query
  operations in computer science and formal languages. Many applications\, 
 such as network intrusion detection and policy checking for DNS queries\, 
 depend on such queries which are also increasingly concerned with privacy 
 issues. This dissertation demonstrates a private regular expression patter
 n-matching design based on the oblivious stack and transfer protocols. The
  former results in the best-known asymptotic complexity for regular expres
 sion pattern matching\, while the latter leads to optimal numerical perfor
 mance.\n\n\n\nhttps://cpsc.yale.edu/event/dissertation-defense-ning-luo
