DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium - Theo Jepsen\n\nHost: Rober
 t Soulé\n\nTitle: Packet Subscriptions for Programmable ASICs\n\nAbstract
 :\n\nIn this talk\, I explore how programmable data planes can provide a h
 igher-level of service to user applications via a new abstraction called p
 acket subscriptions. Packet subscriptions generalize forwarding rules\, an
 d can be used to express both traditional routing and more esoteric\, cont
 ent-based approaches. We describe a compiler for packet subscriptions that
  uses a novel BDD-based algorithm to efficiently translate predicates into
  P4 tables that can support O(100K) expressions. Using our compiler\, we
 ’ve built a proof-of-concept pub/sub financial application for splitting
  market feeds (e.g.\, Nasdaq’s ITCH protocol) with line-rate message pro
 cessing\, using the full switch bandwidth of 6.5Tbps.\n\nBio:\n\nTheo Jeps
 en received his BA at Cornell University\, Masters at University of Wiscon
 sin Madison\, and is currently in his fourth year of a PhD program at USI\
 , Universita della Svizzera Italiana. His research interests are in in dis
 tributed systems\, networking and programmable data planes.\n
