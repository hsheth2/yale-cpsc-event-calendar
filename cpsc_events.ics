DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nAlex Aiken\, Stanford Unive
 rsity\n\nTitle: Legion: Programming Heterogeneous\, Distributed Parallel M
 achines\n\nAbstract:\n\nProgrammers tend to think of parallel programming 
 as a problem of dividing up computation\, but often the most difficult par
 t is the placement and movement of data.  As machines become more complex
  and hierarchical\, describing what to do with the data is increasingly a 
 first-class programming concern.  Legion is a programming model and runti
 me system for describing hierarchical organizations of both data and compu
 tation at an abstract level. A separate mapping interface allows programme
 rs to control how data and computation are placed onto the actual memories
  and processors of a specific machine.  This talk will present the design
  of Legion\, the novel issues that arise in both the design and implementa
 tion\, and experience with applications.\n\nBio:\n\nAlex Aiken is the Alca
 tel-Lucent Professor of Computer Science at Stanford. Alex received his Ba
 chelors degree in Computer Science and Music from Bowling Green State Univ
 ersity in 1983 and his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1988. Alex was a R
 esearch Staff Member at the IBM Almaden Research Center (1988-1993) and a 
 Professor in the EECS department at UC Berkeley (1993-2003) before joining
  the Stanford faculty in 2003. His research interest is in areas related t
 o programming languages. He is an ACM Fellow\, a recipient of ACM SIGPLAN
 ’s Programming Languages Achievement Award and Phi Beta Kappa’s Teachi
 ng Award\, and a former chair of the Stanford Computer Science Department.
