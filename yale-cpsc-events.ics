DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk - Manolis Zampetakis\, MIT\n\nHost
 : Yang Cai\n\nTitle: Computationally and Statistically Efficient Truncated
  Statistics\n\nAbstract:\n\nCensoring and truncation occur when data falli
 ng outside of a subset of the population are not observable. In practice\,
  it often arises as a result of saturation of measurement devices\, experi
 mental design\, and legal or privacy constraints preventing the use of som
 e of the data. Such phenomena have been known to affect experimental resul
 ts in a counterintuitive way\, as per Berkson’s paradox.\n\nIn our recen
 t work\, we provide the first provably computationally and statistically e
 fficient methods accomplishing the fundamental task of statistical estimat
 ion for the entire population out of exclusively censored data. Our first 
 result [w/ Daskalakis\, Gouleakis\, Tzamos FOCS’18] assumes that the pop
 ulation follows a multi-dimensional normal distribution and the survival s
 et is known. In follow-up works\, we have extended our result to the case 
 of censored linear [w/ Daskalakis\, Gouleakis\, Tzamos COLT’19]\, logist
 ic and probit regression [w/ Daskalakis\, Ilyas\, Rao ‘19] and we have a
 lso explored the case of unknown survival set [w/ Kontonis\, Tzamos FOCS
 ’19].\n\nBio:\n\nManolis is a Ph.D. Student in the Theory of Computation
  Group at MIT working on theoretical problems in: machine learning and lea
 rning theory\, complexity theory\, and algorithmic game theory. Before MIT
 \, Manolis was an undergraduate student at National Technical University o
 f Athens. He has been an intern at Google Research NYC\, Yahoo! Research N
 YC and Microsoft Research New England. His graduate studies have been supp
 orted by a Google Ph.D. Fellowship.\n

 tle: AI Ethics\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nAI is going to brin
 g huge benefits in terms of scientific progress\, human wellbeing\, econom
 ic value\, and the possibility of finding solutions to major social and en
 vironmental problems. Supported by AI\, we will be able to make more groun
 ded decisions and to focus on the main values and goals of a decision proc
 ess rather than on routine and repetitive tasks. However\, such a powerful
  technology also raises some concerns\, related for example to the black-b
 ox nature of some AI approaches\, the possible discriminatory decisions th
 at AI algorithms may recommend\, and the accountability and responsibility
  when an AI system is involved in an undesirable outcome. Also\, since man
 y successful AI techniques rely on huge amounts of data\, it is important 
 to know how data are handled by AI systems and by those who produce them. 
 These concerns are among the obstacles that hold AI back or that cause wor
 ry for current AI users\, adopters\, and policy makers. Without answers to
  these questions\, many will not trust AI\, and therefore will not fully a
 dopt it nor get its positive impact. In this talk I will present the main 
 issues around AI ethics\, describe some of the proposed technical solution
 s\, and mention some of the many initiatives that have been built in the p
 ast few years to address the technical\, policy\, and legal challenges\, a
 s well as the ethical concerns\, around AI.\n\nBio:\n\nIBM AI Ethics Globa
 l Leader and Distinguished Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Previous
 ly\, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Padova\, Italy.\n\
 nHer research interests focus on artificial intelligence\, specifically th
 ey include constraint reasoning\, preferences\, multi-agent systems\, comp
 utational social choice\, and collective decision making. She is also inte
 rested in ethical issues in the development and behaviour of AI systems\, 
 in particular for decision support systems for group decision making. She 
 has published over 190 scientific articles in journals and conference proc
 eedings\, and as book chapters. She has co-authored a book and she has edi
 ted 17 volumes\, between conference proceedings\, collections of contribut
 ions\, special issues of journals\, and a handbook. She is a fellow of bot
 h the worldwide association of AI (AAAI) and of the European one (EurAI). 
 She has been president of IJCAI (International Joint Conference on AI)\, a
 n executive councillor of AAAI\, and the Editor in Chief of the Journal of
  AI Research. She is a member of the scientific advisory board of the Futu
 re of Life Institute (Cambridge\, USA) and a deputy director of the Leverh
 ulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (Cambridge\, UK). She is in the
  executive committee of the IEEE global initiative on ethical consideratio
 ns on the development of autonomous intelligent systems and she is a membe
 r of the board of directors of the Partnership on AI\, where she represent
 s IBM as one of the founding partners. She is a member of the European Com
 mission High Level Expert Group on AI and the general chair of the AAI 202
 0 conference.\n\n
