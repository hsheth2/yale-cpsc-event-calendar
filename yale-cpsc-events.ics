 tle: AI Ethics\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nAI is going to brin
 g huge benefits in terms of scientific progress\, human wellbeing\, econom
 ic value\, and the possibility of finding solutions to major social and en
 vironmental problems. Supported by AI\, we will be able to make more groun
 ded decisions and to focus on the main values and goals of a decision proc
 ess rather than on routine and repetitive tasks. However\, such a powerful
  technology also raises some concerns\, related for example to the black-b
 ox nature of some AI approaches\, the possible discriminatory decisions th
 at AI algorithms may recommend\, and the accountability and responsibility
  when an AI system is involved in an undesirable outcome. Also\, since man
 y successful AI techniques rely on huge amounts of data\, it is important 
 to know how data are handled by AI systems and by those who produce them. 
 These concerns are among the obstacles that hold AI back or that cause wor
 ry for current AI users\, adopters\, and policy makers. Without answers to
  these questions\, many will not trust AI\, and therefore will not fully a
 dopt it nor get its positive impact. In this talk I will present the main 
 issues around AI ethics\, describe some of the proposed technical solution
 s\, and mention some of the many initiatives that have been built in the p
 ast few years to address the technical\, policy\, and legal challenges\, a
 s well as the ethical concerns\, around AI.\n\nBio:\n\nIBM AI Ethics Globa
 l Leader and Distinguished Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Previous
 ly\, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Padova\, Italy.\n\
 nHer research interests focus on artificial intelligence\, specifically th
 ey include constraint reasoning\, preferences\, multi-agent systems\, comp
 utational social choice\, and collective decision making. She is also inte
 rested in ethical issues in the development and behaviour of AI systems\, 
 in particular for decision support systems for group decision making. She 
 has published over 190 scientific articles in journals and conference proc
 eedings\, and as book chapters. She has co-authored a book and she has edi
 ted 17 volumes\, between conference proceedings\, collections of contribut
 ions\, special issues of journals\, and a handbook. She is a fellow of bot
 h the worldwide association of AI (AAAI) and of the European one (EurAI). 
 She has been president of IJCAI (International Joint Conference on AI)\, a
 n executive councillor of AAAI\, and the Editor in Chief of the Journal of
  AI Research. She is a member of the scientific advisory board of the Futu
 re of Life Institute (Cambridge\, USA) and a deputy director of the Leverh
 ulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (Cambridge\, UK). She is in the
  executive committee of the IEEE global initiative on ethical consideratio
 ns on the development of autonomous intelligent systems and she is a membe
 r of the board of directors of the Partnership on AI\, where she represent
 s IBM as one of the founding partners. She is a member of the European Com
 mission High Level Expert Group on AI and the general chair of the AAI 202

SUMMARY:Poynter Fellowship in Journalism - Ashlyn Still\, Graphics Reporte

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nPoynter Fellowship in Journalism\nAshlyn S
 till\, Graphics Reporter\nWashington Post\n\nHolly Rushmeier\nis hosting A
 shlyn Still\n\nNews Graphics and Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe media
  landscape is changing rapidly and the tools used for reporting and storyt
 elling are changing with it. New technologies have made data analysis and 
 visualization more accessible for reporters to tell stories in new and dif
 ferent ways. The graphics team at The Washington Post is no exception – 
 they produce award-winning visual storytelling using data\, design\, code\
 , cartography\, illustration\, animation\, augmented reality and more. We
 ’ll take a look at how graphics reporters at The Post are using all of t
 hese methods to enhance their storytelling and better reach audiences in b
 oth the print and digital space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshlyn Still is a graphics
  reporter covering elections and politics at The Washington Post. She spen
 ds most of her time with the elections team\, creating maps\, charts and o
 ther visualizations to bring live election results to audiences on all pla
 tforms. Before joining The Post\, she was a developer on the graphics team
  at Reuters in New York\, focusing on policy\, politics\, economics and la
 bor coverage. She has also worked as a news applications developer at The 
 Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ashlyn graduated from the University of Nort
 h Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism and Mas
 s Communication.\n\nhttps://communications.yale.edu/poynter/ashlyn-still\n
 \n\n\n\n\nThe Poynter Fellowship plays a unique role in the educational li
 fe of Yale University. Nelson Poynter (Yale\, M.A. 1927) established the p
 rogram to enable Yale to bring to its campus distinguished reporters\, edi
 tors and others who have made important contributions to the media.\n\n\n\

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Theo Jepsen

 :\n\nIn this talk\, I explore how programmable data planes can provide a h
 igher-level of service to user applications via a new abstraction called p
 acket subscriptions. Packet subscriptions generalize forwarding rules\, an
 d can be used to express both traditional routing and more esoteric\, cont
 ent-based approaches. We describe a compiler for packet subscriptions that
  uses a novel BDD-based algorithm to efficiently translate predicates into
  P4 tables that can support O(100K) expressions. Using our compiler\, we
 ’ve built a proof-of-concept pub/sub financial application for splitting
  market feeds (e.g.\, Nasdaq’s ITCH protocol) with line-rate message pro
 cessing\, using the full switch bandwidth of 6.5Tbps.\n\nBio:\n\nTheo Jeps
 en received his BA at Cornell University\, Masters at University of Wiscon
 sin Madison\, and is currently in his fourth year of a PhD program at USI\
 , Universita della Svizzera Italiana. His research interests are in in dis
 tributed systems\, networking and programmable data planes.\n
