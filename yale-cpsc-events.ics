DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nRajiv Gandhi - Rutgers University
 \, Camden\n\nHost: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nTitle: From Potential to Prom
 ise - Developing Scholars\, one Eureka moment at a time\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn
  this talk\, I will tell the story of our work with some truly remarkable 
 undergraduate students at Rutgers-Camden\, who despite many odds have achi
 eved success that is unprecedented for the Camden campus. I will discuss t
 he various challenges that we faced and some ideas that have worked very w
 ell (and some that have not) for us. We have been applying some of these i
 deas in our work with high school students and students at other instituti
 ons.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Rajiv Gandhi is a Professor of Computer Science at the
  Rutgers University-Camden. He also teaches at the University of Pennsylva
 nia. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2003 from the University
  of Maryland\, College Park. His research interests  lie in the broad are
 a of theoretical computer science. Specifically\, he is interested in appr
 oximation and randomized algorithms.  He is a passionate educator who lov
 es working with students with diverse backgrounds\, helping them achieve t
 heir potential. He has been the recipient of several teaching excellence a
 wards\, including the Warren I. Susman award for teaching excellence at Ru
 tgers University in 2014. He also received the Chancellor’s award for Ci
 vic Engagement at Rutgers-Camden in 2013. In 2017 he was inducted in the 
  Computer Science Alumni Hall of Fame at the University of Maryland. He w
 as a Fulbright Fellow from Jan-June 2011\, during which he worked with stu
 dents in Mumbai\, India. Since 2009\, he has also been working with high s
 chool students as part of the Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thi
 nking  (\nhttp://algorithmicthinking.org\n).\n

SUMMARY:Computer Science Distinguished Speaker Series and Computation & So

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nComputer Science Distinguished Speaker Ser
 ies and Computation & Society Colloquium\n\nSpeaker: Francesca Rossi\n\nTi
 tle: AI Ethics\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nAI is going to brin
 g huge benefits in terms of scientific progress\, human wellbeing\, econom
 ic value\, and the possibility of finding solutions to major social and en
 vironmental problems. Supported by AI\, we will be able to make more groun
 ded decisions and to focus on the main values and goals of a decision proc
 ess rather than on routine and repetitive tasks. However\, such a powerful
  technology also raises some concerns\, related for example to the black-b
 ox nature of some AI approaches\, the possible discriminatory decisions th
 at AI algorithms may recommend\, and the accountability and responsibility
  when an AI system is involved in an undesirable outcome. Also\, since man
 y successful AI techniques rely on huge amounts of data\, it is important 
 to know how data are handled by AI systems and by those who produce them. 
 These concerns are among the obstacles that hold AI back or that cause wor
 ry for current AI users\, adopters\, and policy makers. Without answers to
  these questions\, many will not trust AI\, and therefore will not fully a
 dopt it nor get its positive impact. In this talk I will present the main 
 issues around AI ethics\, describe some of the proposed technical solution
 s\, and mention some of the many initiatives that have been built in the p
 ast few years to address the technical\, policy\, and legal challenges\, a
 s well as the ethical concerns\, around AI.\n\nBio:\n\nIBM AI Ethics Globa
 l Leader and Distinguished Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Previous
 ly\, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Padova\, Italy.\n\
 nHer research interests focus on artificial intelligence\, specifically th
 ey include constraint reasoning\, preferences\, multi-agent systems\, comp
 utational social choice\, and collective decision making. She is also inte
 rested in ethical issues in the development and behaviour of AI systems\, 
 in particular for decision support systems for group decision making. She 
 has published over 190 scientific articles in journals and conference proc
 eedings\, and as book chapters. She has co-authored a book and she has edi
 ted 17 volumes\, between conference proceedings\, collections of contribut
 ions\, special issues of journals\, and a handbook. She is a fellow of bot
 h the worldwide association of AI (AAAI) and of the European one (EurAI). 
 She has been president of IJCAI (International Joint Conference on AI)\, a
 n executive councillor of AAAI\, and the Editor in Chief of the Journal of
  AI Research. She is a member of the scientific advisory board of the Futu
 re of Life Institute (Cambridge\, USA) and a deputy director of the Leverh
 ulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (Cambridge\, UK). She is in the
  executive committee of the IEEE global initiative on ethical consideratio
 ns on the development of autonomous intelligent systems and she is a membe
 r of the board of directors of the Partnership on AI\, where she represent
 s IBM as one of the founding partners. She is a member of the European Com
 mission High Level Expert Group on AI and the general chair of the AAI 202
 0 conference.\n\n
