 ter\n\nHost: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nTitle: The Next Quintillion Pixels 
 and Beyond: Architecting Next-Generation Mobile Visual Computing Systems\n
 \nAbstract:\n\nAddressing the world’s more pressing issues such as healt
 hcare and environmental sustainability increasingly relies on diverse visu
 al applications running on emerging platforms such as AR/VR headsets\, aut
 onomous machines\, and smart-city sensor nodes. In real-time and using low
  power\, visual computing systems must generate visual data for humans to 
 consume\, immersively\, or interpret visual data to provide personalized s
 ervices\, intelligently.\n\nIn this talk\, I will explain why today’s co
 mputer systems and architecture are not ready for the visual computing app
 lications on the horizon\, and outline the road that might get us there. F
 undamentally\, we have been over-emphasizing the vertical\, domain-specifi
 c architecture design while future visual applications inherently encompas
 s tasks from multiple domains. Simple stitching together systems designed 
 and optimized for individual domains leads to a sub-optimal whole. I promo
 te a horizontal\, cross-domain mindset\, and present two case-studies in c
 ontinuous vision and point cloud processing.\n\nBio:\n\nYuhao Zhu is an As
 sistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Rochester. Prev
 iously he was a visiting researcher at ARM Research and a Research Fellow 
 at Harvard University before receiving his Ph.D. from The University of Te
 xas at Austin. His current research focuses on architecting future visual 
 computing systems. He received the Honorable Mention of the 2018 ACM SIGAR
 CH/IEEE-CS TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award\, IEEE Micro Top Picks from
  Computer Architecture Conferences (2015\, 2018)\, and Best Paper Award/No
 minee of MICRO 2019 and CAL 2014. More about his group’s research can be

SUMMARY:CS Talk - Tim Roughgarden\, Columbia University

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk -\nTim Roughgarden\, Columbia Univ
 ersity\n\nHosts: Yang Cai and Dirk Bergemann\n\nTitle: How Computer Scien
 ce Informs Modern Auction Design\n\nAbstract:\n\nOver the last twenty year
 s\, computer science has relied on concepts borrowed from game theory and 
 economics to reason about applications ranging from internet routing to re
 al-time auctions for online advertising. More recently\, ideas have increa
 singly flowed in the opposite direction\, with concepts and techniques fro
 m computer science beginning to influence economic theory and practice.\n\
 nIn this talk\, I will illustrate this point with a detailed case study of
  the 2016-2017 Federal Communications Commission incentive auction for rep
 urposing wireless spectrum. Computer science techniques\, ranging from alg
 orithms for NP-hard problems to nondeterministic communication complexity\
 , have played a critical role both in the design of the reverse auction (w
 ith the government procuring existing licenses from television broadcaster
 s) and in the analysis of the forward auction (when the procured licenses 
 sell to the highest bidder).\n\nBio:\n\nTim Roughgarden is a Professor of 
 Computer Science at Columbia University. Prior to joining Columbia\, he sp
 ent 15 years on the computer science faculty at Stanford\, following a PhD
  at Cornell and a postdoc at UC Berkeley. His research interests include t
 he many connections between computer science and economics\, as well as th
 e design\, analysis\, applications\, and limitations of algorithms. For hi
 s research\, he has been awarded the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award\, the P
 residential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE)\, the
  Kalai Prize in Computer Science and Game Theory\, the Social Choice and W
 elfare Prize\, the Mathematical Programming Society’s Tucker Prize\, and
  the EATCS-SIGACT Gödel Prize. He was an invited speaker at the 2006 Inte
 rnational Congress of Mathematicians\, the Shapley Lecturer at the 2008 Wo
 rld Congress of the Game Theory Society\, and a Guggenheim Fellow in 2017.
  His books include Twenty Lectures on Algorithmic Game Theory (2016) and t
 he Algorithms Illuminated book series (2017-2019).\n

SUMMARY:CS Colloquium - Sandhya Dwarkadas\, University of Rochester

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium\nSandhya Dwarkadas\, Univers
 ity of Rochester\n\nHost: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nTitle: Toward Efficien
 t and Protected Address Translation in Memory Management\n\nMemory managem
 ent support on state-of-the-art architectures and operating systems encoun
 ters performance and protection challenges for today’s applications and 
 execution environments.\n\nIn particular\, a variety of services\, ranging
  from compilers to web user-interface frameworks (whether on mobile or ser
 ver platforms)\, which provide the infrastructure for many high-level appl
 ications\, suffer from performance degradation due to instruction address 
 translation overheads.\n\nIn this talk\, I will focus largely on the instr
 uction path to highlight\n\n(1) the impact of instruction address translat
 ion on performance (including the importance of using superpages)\;\n\n(2)
  the need to rethink protection architectures for performance\; and\n\n(3)
  techniques that enable page table and translation lookaside buffer sharin
 g across applications.\n\nMemory management can also be a source for side 
 channel attacks in compromised operating systems.\n\nI will describe techn
 iques that harden compiler-based approaches to protecting application data
  from compromised operating systems against page table\, last-level cache 
 (LLC)\, and speculation side-channel attacks.\n\nAs time permits\, I will 
 also provide a glimpse of ongoing work on sharing-aware resource managemen
 t for multicore systems with a goal of simultaneously achieving high overa
 ll system efficiency and individual application progress guarantees.\n\nBi
 o:\n\nSandhya Dwarkadas is the Albert Arendt Hopeman Professor of Engineer
 ing\, and Professor and Chair of Computer Science with a secondary appoint
 ment in Electrical and Computer Engineering\, at University of Rochester\,
  where she has been on the faculty since 1996.\n\nShe received her Bachelo
 r’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology\, Madras\, India\, an
 d her M.S. and Ph.D. from Rice University.\n\nShe is a fellow of the ACM a
 nd IEEE.\n\nShe is also a member of the board and steering committee for t
 he Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation 
 (CRA-WP).\n\nHer areas of research interest include computer architecture\
 , parallel and distributed systems\, and the interaction and interface bet
 ween the compiler\, runtime/operating system\, and underlying architecture
 .\n\nShe has made fundamental contributions to the design and implementati
 on of shared memory both in hardware and in software\, and to hardware and
  software energy- and resource-aware configurability.\n
