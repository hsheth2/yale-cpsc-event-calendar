DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk - Aasheesh Kolli\, Pennsylvania St
 ate University\n\nTitle: Architecting Persistent Memory Systems\n\nHost: A
 bhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nAbstract:\n\nPersistent Memory (PM) technologies 
 (also known as Non-Volatile RAM\, e.g.\, Intel’s 3D XPoint) offer the ex
 citing possibility of disk-like durability with the performance of main me
 mory. Persistent memory systems provide applications with direct access to
  storage media via processor load and store instructions rather than havin
 g to rely on performance sapping software intermediaries like the operatin
 g system\, aiding the development of high-performance\, recoverable softwa
 re. For example\, I envision storage software that provides the safety and
  correctness of a conventional database management system like PostgreSQL 
 and the performance of an in-memory store like Redis. However\, today’s 
 computing systems have been optimized for block storage devices and cannot
  fully exploit the benefits of PMs. Designing efficient systems for this n
 ew storage paradigm requires a careful rethink of computer architectures\,
  programming interfaces\, and application software.\n\nWhile maintaining r
 ecoverable data structures in main memory is the central appeal of persist
 ent memories\, current systems do not provide efficient mechanisms (if any
 ) to do so.  Ensuring the recoverability of these data structures require
 s constraining the order of PM writes\, whereas current architectures are 
 designed to reorder memory accesses\, transparent to the programmer\, for 
 performance. In this talk\, I will introduce recently proposed programming
  interfaces\, called persistency models\, that will allow programmers to e
 xpress the required order of PM writes. Then\, I will present my work on d
 eveloping efficient hardware implementations to enforce the PM write order
  prescribed by persistency models and tailoring software for these new pro
 gramming interfaces.\n\nBio:\n\nAasheesh Kolli is an assistant professor a
 t Pennsylvania State University and an affiliated researcher with VMware R
 esearch. His interests are in computer systems architecture\; his work inc
 ludes processor architectures\, memory subsystems\, programming interfaces
 \, and systems software. His recent research focuses on designing next-gen
 eration memory systems\, particularly on persistent memory and disaggregte
 d memory systems. Aasheesh received his PhD (2017) and MS (2013) from the 
 University of Michigan\, and his BE (2011) from BITS-Pilani in India. His 
 work has resulted in multiple research papers\, including best paper award

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk\nRajiv Gandhi - Rutgers University
 \, Camden\n\nHost: Abhishek Bhattacharjee\n\nTitle: From Potential to Prom
 ise - Developing Scholars\, one Eureka moment at a time\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn
  this talk\, I will tell the story of our work with some truly remarkable 
 undergraduate students at Rutgers-Camden\, who despite many odds have achi
 eved success that is unprecedented for the Camden campus. I will discuss t
 he various challenges that we faced and some ideas that have worked very w
 ell (and some that have not) for us. We have been applying some of these i
 deas in our work with high school students and students at other instituti
 ons.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Rajiv Gandhi is a Professor of Computer Science at the
  Rutgers University-Camden. He also teaches at the University of Pennsylva
 nia. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2003 from the University
  of Maryland\, College Park. His research interests  lie in the broad are
 a of theoretical computer science. Specifically\, he is interested in appr
 oximation and randomized algorithms.  He is a passionate educator who lov
 es working with students with diverse backgrounds\, helping them achieve t
 heir potential. He has been the recipient of several teaching excellence a
 wards\, including the Warren I. Susman award for teaching excellence at Ru
 tgers University in 2014. He also received the Chancellor’s award for Ci
 vic Engagement at Rutgers-Camden in 2013. In 2017 he was inducted in the 
  Computer Science Alumni Hall of Fame at the University of Maryland. He w
 as a Fulbright Fellow from Jan-June 2011\, during which he worked with stu
 dents in Mumbai\, India. Since 2009\, he has also been working with high s
 chool students as part of the Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thi
 nking  (\nhttp://algorithmicthinking.org\n).\n

SUMMARY:CS Talk - Manolis Zampetakis\, MIT

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Talk - Manolis Zampetakis\, MIT\n\nHost
 : Yang Cai\n\nTitle: Computationally and Statistically Efficient Truncated
  Statistics\n\nAbstract:\n\nCensoring and truncation occur when data falli
 ng outside of a subset of the population are not observable. In practice\,
  it often arises as a result of saturation of measurement devices\, experi
 mental design\, and legal or privacy constraints preventing the use of som
 e of the data. Such phenomena have been known to affect experimental resul
 ts in a counterintuitive way\, as per Berkson’s paradox.\n\nIn our recen
 t work\, we provide the first provably computationally and statistically e
 fficient methods accomplishing the fundamental task of statistical estimat
 ion for the entire population out of exclusively censored data. Our first 
 result [w/ Daskalakis\, Gouleakis\, Tzamos FOCS’18] assumes that the pop
 ulation follows a multi-dimensional normal distribution and the survival s
 et is known. In follow-up works\, we have extended our result to the case 
 of censored linear [w/ Daskalakis\, Gouleakis\, Tzamos COLT’19]\, logist
 ic and probit regression [w/ Daskalakis\, Ilyas\, Rao ‘19] and we have a
 lso explored the case of unknown survival set [w/ Kontonis\, Tzamos FOCS
 ’19].\n\nBio:\n\nManolis is a Ph.D. Student in the Theory of Computation
  Group at MIT working on theoretical problems in: machine learning and lea
 rning theory\, complexity theory\, and algorithmic game theory. Before MIT
 \, Manolis was an undergraduate student at National Technical University o
 f Athens. He has been an intern at Google Research NYC\, Yahoo! Research N
 YC and Microsoft Research New England. His graduate studies have been supp
 orted by a Google Ph.D. Fellowship.\n

 tle: AI Ethics\n\nHost: Dragomir Radev\n\nAbstract:\n\nAI is going to brin
 g huge benefits in terms of scientific progress\, human wellbeing\, econom
 ic value\, and the possibility of finding solutions to major social and en
 vironmental problems. Supported by AI\, we will be able to make more groun
 ded decisions and to focus on the main values and goals of a decision proc
 ess rather than on routine and repetitive tasks. However\, such a powerful
  technology also raises some concerns\, related for example to the black-b
 ox nature of some AI approaches\, the possible discriminatory decisions th
 at AI algorithms may recommend\, and the accountability and responsibility
  when an AI system is involved in an undesirable outcome. Also\, since man
 y successful AI techniques rely on huge amounts of data\, it is important 
 to know how data are handled by AI systems and by those who produce them. 
 These concerns are among the obstacles that hold AI back or that cause wor
 ry for current AI users\, adopters\, and policy makers. Without answers to
  these questions\, many will not trust AI\, and therefore will not fully a
 dopt it nor get its positive impact. In this talk I will present the main 
 issues around AI ethics\, describe some of the proposed technical solution
 s\, and mention some of the many initiatives that have been built in the p
 ast few years to address the technical\, policy\, and legal challenges\, a
 s well as the ethical concerns\, around AI.\n\nBio:\n\nIBM AI Ethics Globa
