DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Graph Representation Learning: Recent A
 dvances and Open Challenges”\n\nSpeaker: William L. Hamilton\n\nAssistan
 t Professor\, School of Computer Science\, McGill University\n\nTalk Summa
 ry:\nGraph-structured data is ubiquitous throughout the natural and social
  sciences\, from telecommunication networks to quantum chemistry. Building
  relational inductive biases into deep learning architectures is crucial i
 f we want systems that can learn\, reason\, and generalize from this kind 
 of data. Recent years have seen a surge in research on graph representatio
 n learning\, most prominently in the development of graph neural networks 
 (GNNs). Advances in GNNs have led to state-of-the-art results in numerous 
 domains\, including chemical synthesis\, 3D-vision\, recommender systems\,
  question answering\, and social network analysis. In the first part of th
 is talk I will provide an overview and summary of recent progress in this 
 fast-growing area\, highlighting foundational methods and theoretical moti
 vations. In the second part of this talk I will discuss fundamental limita
 tions of the current GNN paradigm. Finally\, I will conclude the talk by d
 iscussing recent progress my group has made in advancing graph representat
 ion learning beyond the GNN paradigm.\n\nTo participate:\nJoin from PC\, M

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar: Emily Breza (Harvard)\n\n“
 Effects of caste-based affirmative action in governance on socio-economic 
 networks and resource provision”\n\n\nSpeaker: Emily Breza\n\nAssistant 
 Professor of Economics\, Harvard University\n\n\nTalk Summary:\nWe study t
 he impacts of political affirmative action for historically disadvantaged 
 caste groups in Bihar\, India on village social and economic networks. The
 se networks shape the socio-economic landscape\, serving many functions su
 ch as facilitating social learning\, risk-sharing and public good provisio
 n. To estimate the causal impacts of the policy\, we conduct surveys in co
 mmunities around the discontinuity in the state government’s policy assi
 gnment rule.\n\nWe have two main findings. First\, the marginal constituen
 cy assigned to the reservation policy experiences a drop in cross-caste ne
 twork links and an increase in homophily. Consistent with increased homoph
 ily\, reservation leads to less social learning when information is introd
 uced to the community – on average there is worse knowledge about health
  preserving behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Further\, the declin
 e in meetings across caste is met with weakened norms about the appropriat
 eness of cross-caste interactions. Second\, we turn to resource access and
  find that the reservation improves access to redistribution schemes as we
 ll as the agility of governmental response to provide resources in respons
 e to shocks. Both lower and upper castes benefited\, indicating no crowd-o
 ut at the expense of upper castes.\n\nStrikingly\, we find no decline in t
 he salience of caste concerns and no shifts in beliefs about trustworthine
 ss\, competence\, or work ethic\, among others\, across caste. So\, the in
 creased homophily is not met with increased animus\; norm shifts are drive
 n by meeting shifts. Our findings suggest that there is scope for pairing 
 reservation with other interventions to mitigate the impacts of affirmativ
 e action on fractionalization while preserving the resource allocation ben
 efits.\n\n(joint with Arun Chandrasekhar and M. R. Sharan)\n\nTo Participa

 Professor in the Economics Department at Harvard University. She received 
 her PhD in Economics from MIT and her BA from Yale University. Prior to jo
 ining Harvard\, Emily held a faculty appointment at Columbia Business Scho
 ol. She has faculty affiliations at the National Bureau of Economic Resear
 ch\, the Jameel Poverty Action Lab\, the International Growth Centre\, and
  the Centre for Economic Policy Research.  She is a 2020 recipient of the
  Sloan Research Fellowship.\n\nHer research focuses on development economi
 cs\, social networks\, and household finance. She has conducted experiment
 s to optimize information disseminate through village social networks in t
 he context of the Indian demonetization and has studied how the social net
 work interacts with the types of formal and informal financial products co
 mmon to developing countries. Emily has also developed empirical methods f
 or measuring socio-economic networks.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/even
