DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Exploring Robustness and
  Energy-Efficiency in Neural Systems with Spike-based Machine Intelligence
 ”\n\nSpeaker: Priya Panda\nAssistant Professor\, Electrical Engineering\
 , Yale University\n\nAbstract:\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recent
 ly emerged as an alternative to deep learning due to their huge energy eff
 iciency benefits on neuromorphic hardware. In this presentation\, I will t
 alk about important techniques for training SNNs which bring a huge benefi
 t in terms of latency\, accuracy\, interpretability\, and robustness. We w
 ill first delve into how training is performed in SNNs. Training SNNs with
  surrogate gradients presents computational benefits due to short latency.
  However\, due to the non-differentiable nature of spiking neurons\, the t
 raining becomes problematic and surrogate methods have thus been limited t
 o shallow networks. To address this training issue with surrogate gradient
 s\, we will go over a recently proposed method Batch Normalization Through
  Time (BNTT) that allows us to train SNNs from scratch with very low laten
 cy and enables us to target interesting applications like video segmentati
 on and beyond traditional learning scenarios\, like federated training. An
 other critical limitation of SNNs is the lack of interpretability. While a
  considerable amount of attention has been given to optimizing SNNs\, the 
 development of explainability still is at its infancy. I will talk about o
 ur recent work on a bio-plausible visualization tool for SNNs\, called Spi
 ke Activation Map (SAM) compatible with BNTT training. The proposed SAM hi
 ghlights spikes having short inter-spike interval\, containing discriminat
 ive information for classification. Finally\, with proposed BNTT and SAM\,
  I will highlight the robustness aspect of SNNs with respect to adversaria
 l attacks. In the end\, I will talk about interesting prospects of SNNs fo
 r non-conventional learning scenarios such as privacy-preserving distribut
 ed learning as well as unraveling the temporal correlation in SNNs with fe
 edback connections. Finally\, time permitting\, I will talk about the pros
 pects of SNNs for novel and emerging compute-in-memory hardware that can p
 otentially yield order of magnitude lower power consumption than conventio
 nal CPUs/GPUs.\n\nBio:\nPriya Panda is an assistant professor in the elect

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“A Tale of Two Networks:
  Common Ownership and Product Market Rivalry”\n\nSpeaker: Florian Ederer
 \nAssociate Professor of Economics\, Yale School of Management\n\n\n\nAbst
 ract:\nWe study the welfare implications of the rise of common ownership i
 n the United States from 1994 to 2018. We build a general equilibrium mode
 l with a hedonic demand system in which firms compete in a network game of
  oligopoly. Firms are connected through two large networks: the first refl
 ects ownership overlap\, the second product market rivalry. In our model\,
  common ownership of competing firms induces unilateral incentives to soft
 en competition. The magnitude of the common ownership effect depends on ho
 w much the two networks overlap. We estimate our model for the universe of
  U.S. public corporations using a combination of firm financials\, investo
 r holdings\, and text-based product similarity data. We perform counterfac
 tual calculations to evaluate how the efficiency and the distributional im
 pact of common ownership have evolved over time. According to our baseline
  estimates the welfare cost of common ownership\, measured as the ratio of
  deadweight loss to total surplus\, has increased nearly tenfold (from 0.3
 % to over 4%) between 1994 and 2018. Under alternative assumptions about g
 overnance\, the deadweight loss ranges between 1.9% and 4.4% of total surp
 lus in 2018. The rise of common ownership has also resulted in a significa
 nt reallocation of surplus from consumers to producers.\n\n\n\nhttps://www

 ate Professor of Economics at the Yale School of Management\, a Research S
 taff Member at the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics\, and an NB
 ER faculty research fellow. Professor Ederer’s research\, which has been
  widely published in leading journals\, is in the areas of organizational 
 economics\, innovation\, and antitrust. Some of his recent work explores t
 he impact of networks of common ownership on managerial compensation and p
 roduct market competition and the existence and pervasiveness of “killer
  acquisitions” that prevent startups from challenging dominant market in
 cumbents. In his academic work he draws on a broad set of tools often comb
 ining theoretical models\, experimental methods\, and empirical analysis. 
 Prior to joining the Yale School of Management Professor Ederer was a facu
 lty member of the UCLA Anderson School of Management. He earned his doctor
 ate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology and his mas
 ter’s and undergraduate degrees from the University of Oxford.\n\n\n\nTh
