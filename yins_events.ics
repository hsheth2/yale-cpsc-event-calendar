DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nAbstract\n\nFuture wireless networks will 
 feature the technology “sweet spot” of high bandwidth\, low latency\, 
 and powerful edge computing\, thereby enabling a broad new class of applic
 ations such as augmented reality\, autonomous vehicles\, and smart cities.
  Realizing this vision requires theoretical and experimental research effo
 rts focusing on emerging communication technologies (e.g.\, full-duplex wi
 reless\, beamforming\, millimeter-wave\, and fiber-optics) and their inter
 actions with the higher layers in the network stack.\n\nFull-duplex wirele
 ss – simultaneous transmission and reception at the same frequency – i
 s one of the emerging technologies that has the potential to increase spec
 trum efficiency and reduce communication latency. In this talk\, I will fi
 rst describe our design and optimization of compact single-antenna full-du
 plex radios which are suitable for hand-held devices. Our customized full-
 duplex radios achieve wideband self-interference cancellation using the te
 chnique of frequency-domain equalization (FDE)\, and are experimentally ev
 aluated at the node-\, link-\, and network-level. I will then present a no
 vel approach to enable full-duplex operation in multi-antenna systems by r
 epurposing beamforming degrees of freedom to achieve both wideband self-in
 terference cancellation and improved data rate gain. I will also review ou
 r results on throughput-optimal distributed scheduling in heterogeneous ne
 tworks with both half- and full-duplex users. Finally\, I will briefly des
 cribe the design of the NSF PAWR COSMOS advanced wireless testbed and its 
 ongoing deployment in a ~1 sq. mile area in West Harlem\, New York City. T
 he testbed’s key technological components include programmable millimete
 r-wave radios\, optical x-haul\, and edge cloud. I will conclude by descri
 bing the first-of-their-kind experiments on open-access full-duplex wirele
 ss and converged optical-wireless x-haul networking that we conducted in t
 he COSMOS testbed.\n\nThe full-duplex results are based on joint works wit
 h Mahmood Baraani Dastjerdi\, Jelena Diakonikolas\, Jin Zhou\, Javad Ghade
 ri\, Harish Krishnaswamy\, and Gil Zussman. The COSMOS testbed design and 
 deployment is joint work with the COSMOS team (\nhttp://www.cosmos-lab.org
 /\n).\n\nBio\n\nTingjun Chen is currently a Ph.D. student in the Departmen
 t of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University. He will join the Depar
 tment of Electrical Engineering at Yale University as a postdoctoral assoc
 iate in Fall 2020\, and will join the Department of Electrical and Compute
 r Engineering at Duke University as an assistant professor in Fall 2021. H
 e received the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia Univers
 ity in 2015\, and the B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghu
 a University in 2014. His research interests are in the area of networking
  and communications with a specific focus on future wireless networks and 
 Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. In particular\, he is interested in emer
 ging communication technologies and their interactions with the higher lay
 ers as well as in cross-layer optimization and performance evaluation of n
 etworked systems. He is the student co-lead of the inter-disciplinary Colu
 mbia FlexICoN project and is highly involved in the design and deployment 
 of the city-scale NSF PAWR COSMOS advanced wireless testbed. He received a
  number of awards including the Facebook Fellowship in Networking and Conn
 ectivity\, the Wei Family Private Foundation Fellowship\, the Columbia Eng
 ineering Oscar and Verna Byron Fellowship\, and the Columbia University El
 ectrical Engineering Armstrong Memorial Award and Jacob Millman Award. He 
 also received the ACM CoNEXT 2016 Best Paper Award and his paper was an AC
 M MobiHoc 2019 Best Paper Finalist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale
