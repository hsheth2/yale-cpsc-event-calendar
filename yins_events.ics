 s Velegkas\, Insu Han\, Javid Dadashkarimi\n\nJane Lee:\n“Exact Gradient
  Computation for Spiking Neural Networks through Forward Propagation”\n\
 nAbstract:\nDue to potential reset operations in spiking neural networks (
 SNN)\, most prior literature believes gradients cannot be computed for tra
 ining such networks. Prior works have developed methods like surrogate gra
 dients\, ANN-SNN conversion\, heuristic rules\, etc. to train SNN. By inve
 stigating the dynamics of SNN in continuous time\, invoking the implicit f
 unction theorem\, and exploiting the causal structure of such a network\, 
 we are able to show that we can compute exact gradients and suggest a nove
 l algorithm called forward propagation for computing them.\n\nBio:\nJane L
 ee is a first year student in the Computer Science department. Prior\, she
  studied mathematics and computer science at University of Pennsylvania. H
 er general research interests are in machine learning theory.\n\nInsu Han:
 \n“Scalable Sampling for Nonsymmetric Determinantal Point Processes”\n
 \nAbstract:\nA determinantal point process (DPP) is a probabilistic model 
 that assigns a probability to every subset of those items. It is conventio
 nally parameterized by a symmetric matrix but recent work shows that remov
 ing the symmetry constraint can lead to significant predictive performance
  gains for machine learning applications. We first propose a linear-time s
 ampling algorithm for kernels with low-rank structures.  Furthermore\, we
  develop a scalable sublinear-time rejection sampling algorithm by constru
 cting a novel proposal distribution.  Additionally\, we show that imposin
 g certain structural constraints on the NDPP kernel enables us to bound th
 e rejection rate in a way that depends only on the kernel rank.\n\nBio:\nI
 nsu Han is a postdoc in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Yale U
 niversity\, working with Prof. Amin Karbasi. Previously\, he obtained my P
 h.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Inst
 itute of Science and Technology (KAIST)\, advised by Jinwoo Shin. His rese
 arch interests focus on approximate algorithm design and analysis for larg
 e-scale machine learning and its applications.\n\nAdditional speakers:\n\n
