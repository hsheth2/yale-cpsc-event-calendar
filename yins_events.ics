DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Convex Analysis at Infin
 ity: An Introduction to Astral Space”\n\nSpeaker: Robert Schapire\nMicr
 osoft Research\n\nAbstract:\nNot all convex functions have finite minimize
 rs\; some can only be minimized by a sequence as it heads to infinity.  I
 n this work\, we aim to develop a theory for understanding such minimizers
  at infinity.  We study\nastral space\n\, a compact extension of Euclidea
 n space to which such points at infinity have been added.  Astral space i
 s constructed to be as small as possible while still ensuring that all lin
 ear functions can be continuously extended to the new space.  Although no
 t a vector space\, nor even a metric space\, astral space is nevertheless 
 so well-structured as to allow useful and meaningful extensions of such co
 ncepts as convexity\, conjugacy\, and subdifferentials.  We develop these
  concepts and analyze various properties of convex functions on astral spa
 ce\, including the detailed structure of their minimizers\, exact characte
 rizations of continuity\, and convergence of descent algorithms.\n\nThis i
 s joint work with Miroslav Dudík and Matus Telgarsky.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nRo

 Spatiotemporal graph-neural networks for brain dynamics and spatial genomi
 cs\n\nGraph-neural networks (or geometric deep learning) are revolutionizi
 ng machine learning and data science. They combine ideas from graph theory
 \, geometry\, topology\, and deep learning to learn powerful non-linear mo
 dels on graphical data. In the Van Dijk Lab we are developing several new 
 types of graph neural networks\, based on ideas from dynamical systems\, c
 omputer vision\, and natural language processing\, and apply these to dive
 rse biomedical applications. In one application\, we are using graph neura
 l networks to model spatiotemporal brain activity data\, such as whole-cor
 tex calcium imaging and fMRI recordings. In a second application\, we are 
 using graph neural networks to model spatial transcriptomic data – a new
  technology for the measurement of high-dimensional gene expression at the
  single-cell level with spatial resolution. Using our algorithm\, we infer
  cell-cell interactions in measurements from kidney cancer and brain tissu
 e of multiple sclerosis patients. In these projects\, there is the opportu
 nity to focus more on the algorithmic side or on the application\, and you
  will work closely with postdocs and grad students in the lab.\n\nMark Ger

 \n\nWe are currently approaching the broad topic of genome privacy and sec
 urity from two different angles. First\, we are trying to assess the risks
  presented by public genome databases and other genomic information floati
 ng around to individuals. We are interested in coming up with ways to quan
 tify the information leakage in different scenarios\, such as how many SNP
 s would be needed at minimum to identify a person accurately from a DNA sa
 mple taken from a coffee cup they recently left behind. Second\, we are ev
 aluating the performance of different techniques to enable privacy-preserv
 ing genome analysis on cloud computing environments such as AWS\, Azure\, 
 and Google Cloud Platform. These techniques include Homomorphic Encryption
 \, Secure Multiparty Computing\, and Trusted Execution Environments such a
 s the Intel SGX. Each of these techniques involve certain advantages and d
 isadvantages compared to the others when it comes to security and protecti
 on guarantees and strength\, runtime performance\, ease-of-use\, etc. We a
 re always trying to come up with efficient algorithms and data structures 
 that allow the use of these techniques to aid with core bioinformatics tas
 ks such as genotype imputation and genome-wide association studies.\n\nJul

 n: Mapping the Availability of Online Data Work\n\nMany organizations that
  develop data-intensive technologies outsource data generation\, annotatio
 n\, and verification processes through online platforms like Amazon Mechan
 ical Turk\, Remotasks\, and Appen. Data workers are an invisible populatio
 n because platform companies often conceal information about their contrac
 tual workers to researchers. Other options to study this invisible populat
 ion using computational social research methods exist\, including analyzin
 g web traffic data to understand the geography of data work. This talk pre
 sents an ongoing project to study the coloniality of data work\, a crucial
  step in understanding the social conditions in which many data sets are d
 eveloped. The preliminary results show the existence of a North-South divi
 de in data production\, in which most of the demand for data work comes fr
 om the United States and the supply from a handful of countries with parti
 cular social\, economic\, and infrastructural conditions. I collected web 
 traffic data from 93 platforms in 2019-2021 and found that most of the wor
 kers’ traffic comes from Venezuela\, a country experiencing the highest 
 levels of inflation in the world. However\, there was a decline in traffic
  from this country in favor of Kenya during the last recorded time period 
 (Summer 2021). Future work will consider how the Russian invasion of Ukrai
 ne and the impending global financial crisis have and will affect the geog
 raphy of data work in 2022 and early 2023.\n\nNils Rudi\nProfessor\, Yale 
 School of Management\n\nnils.rudi@yale.edu\n\nSoccer in-play probabilities
 \n\nThe question this project look at is how to forecast win probabilities
  and goal distribution during a game of soccer. The difference of two Pois
 son processes calibrated from betting odds provides a simple and quite goo
 d model to estimate soccer in-play win probabilities. In earlier work\, we
  studied such models including some analytical properties and extensions t
 o time-dependent and score dependent goal arrival rates. This project aims
  at extending these models to take into account various elements\, includi
 ng: –Red cards –Other factors for pre-game prediction –Uncertainty (
 error) in parameter estimates –Updating –Metrics for forecasting accur
 acy\, mainly based on scoring rules (Brier score is a simple example). The
  project will require good mastery or R and preferably Python and will mai
 nly use methods from Stochastic Processes\, Markov Chains and Bayesian Met
 hods.\n\nJennifer Marlon\nSenior Research Scientist\, School of the Enviro

 olicy support\, and behavior\n\nTwo project options exist. The first is al
 ready underway and focuses on assessing the effect of extreme weather on i
 ndividual and neighborhood-level climate change vulnerability and adaptati
 on efforts. The second opportunity is starting in January and includes a m
 eta-analysis of hundreds of RCT climate change message experiments across 
 the US and predictive modeling of national climate change advertising camp
 aign effectiveness\, including behavioral outcomes.    Description for P
 roject #1:  In the US\, ideology and demographic factors are the primary 
 determinants of individual’s climate-change related attitudes and behavi
 ors\; for example Democrats are more worried than Republicans and younger 
 Americans are more worried than older Americans. Other factors\, including
  personal experience and local environmental changes have smaller but sign
 ificant influences. Importantly\, unlike ideology and demographics\, these
  latter factors change over time and may provide windows of opportunity to
  encourage individual and collective adaptation and mitigation on climate 
 change. In addition\, such factors play a much larger role in determining 
 attitudes and behaviors outside the U.S. This project aims to identify 1) 
 how much variation in Americans’ climate attitudes is explained by geogr
 aphy and local environmental changes\; 2) which climate hazards are percei
 ved as most serious in different regions\; and 3) how perceptions compare 
 with actual risks\; and 4) how these gaps affect preparedness and adaptati
 on behaviors for different subpopulations. Analysis will be based on a ric
 h US survey dataset (N > 11\,000) of georeferenced respondents coupled wit
 h census\, economic\, political\, weather\, geographic\, and other data. M
 achine learning will be used to develop and validate multilevel regression
  and poststratification (MRP) models for different hazards and subpopulati
 ons. The models will identify individual and higher spatial level contextu
 al predictors of risk and responses at multiple spatial scales. The MRP mo
 dels will then be applied to create neighborhood-level vulnerability maps 
 based on perception as well as traditional data (i.e.\, physical and socio
 demographic factors). This project is focused on the US\, but will have da
 ta from India and the UK for similar analyses.     Details for Project 
 #2 are in development!\n\nWalter Jetz\nProfessor of Ecology & Evolutionary

 o\n\nModeling the geographical and environmental distribution of all speci
 es on the planet at 1km^2\n\nMuch of modern ecology and conservation relie
 s on accurate and reliable predictions of the current spatial distribution
  of species\, the environmental “niche” of those species\, and how bot
 h of these things might change under potential climate change scenarios. O
 n my team\, and alongside our partners\, we are currently well underway wi
 th the effort to produce these models (Species Distribution Models\, SDMs)
  across all terrestrial plant and animal species in North America at 1km^2
 . Modeling species distributions at such a (relatively) fine resolution me
 ans the impact of ecological processes such as dispersal limitations\, bio
 tic interactions\, and more begin to play a more significant role than in 
 coarser resolution models\, meaning we need to develop more sophisticated 
 statistical models capable of capturing these processes. At the same time\
 , the broad scope of our study has introduced a wide array of computationa
 l challenges to making this entire effort tractable. Our team also uses th
 ese SDM products to quantify species’ vulnerability to climate change an
 d habitat loss and to derive optimal conservation strategies jointly acros
 s all species and ecosystems. These analyses as well as our primary SDMs a
 re also made available to our governmental partners and the public via the
