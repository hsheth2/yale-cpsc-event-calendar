DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar: “What is tractable in larg
 e scale reinforcement learning?”\n\nSpeaker: Csaba Szepesvari\n\nProfes
 sor & Canada CIFAR AI Chair\, Amii\nDepartment of Computing Science\nUnive
 rsity of Alberta\n\nTalk summary:\nMarkov decision processes (MDPs) captur
 e some of the most important aspects of decision making under uncertainty 
 and as such they are at the heart of many efforts to decision making under
  uncertainty. However\, MDPs are “flat” with no structure and as such\
 , planning and learning in MDPs with multidimensional state spaces\, commo
 n in applications\, is provably intractable. Yet\, reinforcement learning 
 methods have been quite successful in providing strong solutions to some o
 f these seemingly intractable problems. In this talk I will present my vie
 w of how to think about these successes by presenting a framework where th
 e key idea is to give algorithms hints that can create backdoors to crack 
 otherwise intractable problems. The talk will then dive into categorizing 
  hints based on whether they can indeed succeed at doing this for the spe
 cial case when the hints are given in the form of constraints on how value
  functions look like. As we shall see\, seemingly minor differences betwee
 n hints can cause some hints to work\, while others fail.\n\nTo participat
