DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Discovering an Agent’s
  Configuration Space”\n\nSpeaker:\nJohn Langford\nMicrosoft Research New
  York\n\n\nAbstract:\nGiven potentially very rich and redundant sensory in
 formation which an agent receives\, can the agent discover a configuration
  space summarizing all the configurations it can achieve in an environment
 ?  In 2-d free space this could be x\,y\,theta\, but in environments with
  walls\, movable objects\, and other agents how can this be done?  I’ll
  discuss a basic principle\, theory\, and experimental results suggesting 
 this may be viable for _all_ agents with relatively few environment intera
 ctions.\n\nBio:\nJohn Langford is a computer scientist working in machine 
 learning and learning theory\, a field that he says “is shifting from an
  academic discipline to an industrial tool”.\n\n\n\nHe is well known for
  work on the Isomap embedding algorithm\, CAPTCHA challenges\, Cover Trees
  for nearest neighbor search\, Contextual Bandits (which he coined) for re
 inforcement learning applications\, and learning reductions.\n\n\n\nJohn i
 s the author of the blog hunch.net and the principal developer of Vowpal W
 abbit. He works at Microsoft Research New York\, of which he was one of th
 e founding members\, and was previously affiliated with Yahoo! Research\, 
 Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago\, and IBM’s Watson Research Ce
 nter. He studied Physics and Computer Science at the California Institute 
 of Technology\, earning a double bachelor’s degree in 1997\, and he rece
 ived his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in the 
 year of 2002.\n\n\n\nJohn was the program co-chair for the 2012 Internatio
 nal Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)\, general chair for the 2016 ICM
 L\, and is the President of ICML from 2019–2021.\n\n\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttp

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Convex Analysis at Infin
 ity: An Introduction to Astral Space”\n\nSpeaker: Robert Schapire\nMicr
 osoft Research\n\nAbstract:\nNot all convex functions have finite minimize
 rs\; some can only be minimized by a sequence as it heads to infinity.  I
 n this work\, we aim to develop a theory for understanding such minimizers
  at infinity.  We study\nastral space\n\, a compact extension of Euclidea
 n space to which such points at infinity have been added.  Astral space i
 s constructed to be as small as possible while still ensuring that all lin
 ear functions can be continuously extended to the new space.  Although no
 t a vector space\, nor even a metric space\, astral space is nevertheless 
 so well-structured as to allow useful and meaningful extensions of such co
 ncepts as convexity\, conjugacy\, and subdifferentials.  We develop these
  concepts and analyze various properties of convex functions on astral spa
 ce\, including the detailed structure of their minimizers\, exact characte
 rizations of continuity\, and convergence of descent algorithms.\n\nThis i
 s joint work with Miroslav Dudík and Matus Telgarsky.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nRo
 bert Schapire is a Partner Researcher at Microsoft Research in New York Ci
 ty.  He received his PhD from MIT in 1991.  After a short postdoc at Har
 vard\, he joined the technical staff at AT&T Labs (formerly AT&T Bell Labo
 ratories) in 1991.  In 2002\, he became a Professor of Computer Science 
 at Princeton University.  He joined Microsoft Research in 2014.  His aw
 ards include the 1991 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award\, the 2003 Gödel Pr
 ize\, and the 2004 Kanelakkis Theory and Practice Award (both of the last 
 two with Yoav Freund).  He is a fellow of the AAAI\, and a member of both
  the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences
 .  His main research interest is in theoretical and applied machine learn
 ing.\n\nThis is an in-person seminar with a remote access option:\nhttps:/
