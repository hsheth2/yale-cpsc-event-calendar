 ct:\nThe strong lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) postulates that any neural
  network can be approximated by simply pruning a sufficiently larger netwo
 rk of random weights. Recent work establishes that the strong LTH is true 
 if the random network to be pruned is a large poly-factor wider than the t
 arget one. This polynomial over-parameterization is at odds with experimen
 tal research that achieves good approximation by pruning networks that are
  only a small factor wider than the target one. In this talk\, I will tell
  you how we close this gap and offer an exponential improvement to the ove
 r-parameterization requirement. I will give a sketch of the proof that any
  target network can be approximated by pruning a random one that is only a
  logarithmic factor wider. This is possible by establishing a connection b
 etween pruning random ReLU networks and random instances of the weakly NP-
 hard SubsetSum problem. Our work indicates the existence of a universal st
 riking phenomenon: neural network training is equivalent to pruning slight
 ly overparameterized networks of random weights. I will conclude with shar
 ing hints of a general framework indicating the existence of good pruned n
 etworks for a variety of activation functions\, architectures\, even appli
 cable for the case where both initialization weights and activations are b
 inary.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDimitris Papailiopoulos is an Assistant Professor 
 of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Sciences (by courtesy)
  at the University of Wisconsin-Madison\, a faculty fellow of the Grainger
  Institute for Engineering\, and a faculty affiliate at the Wisconsin Inst
 itute for Discovery. His research interests span machine learning\, inform
 ation theory\, and distributed systems\, with a current focus on communica
 tion-efficient training algorithms and coding-theoretic techniques that gu
 arantee robustness during training and inference. Between 2014 and 2016\, 
 Dimitris was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley and a member of the 
 AMPLab. He earned his Ph.D. in ECE from UT Austin in 2014\, under the supe
 rvision of Alex Dimakis. In 2007 he received his ECE Diploma and in 2009 h
 is M.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Crete\, in Greece. Dimitr
 is is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2019)\, two Sony Faculty Innova
 tion Awards (2019 and 2020)\, the Benjamin Smith Reynolds Award for Excell
 ence in Teaching (2019)\, a joint IEEE ComSoc/ITSoc Best Paper Award (2020
 )\, and an IEEE Signal Processing Society\, Young Author Best Paper Award 
 (2015). In 2018\, he co-founded MLSys\, a new conference that targets rese
 arch at the intersection of machine learning and systems. In 2018 and 2020
  he was program co-chair for MLSys\, and in 2019 he co-chaired the 3rd Mid
 west Machine Learning Symposium.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yin

 mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapses effect reasoning\, intellige
 nce\, language?   Despite dazzling progress in experimental neuroscience\
 , as well as in cognitive  science at the other extreme of scale\, we do 
 not seem to be making progress in the overarching question – the gap is 
 huge and a completely new approach seems to be required.  As Richard Axel
  recently put it:  ”We don’t have a logic for the transformation  of
  neural activity into thought […].”           What kind of formal
  system would qualify as this “logic”?           I will introduce
  a computational system whose basic data structure is the assembly – ass
 emblies are large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\, t
 houghts\, etc. –\, and which is informed by recent  progress in underst
 anding how language happens in the brain.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nChristos Harila
 os Papadimitriou is the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Co
 lumbia University.  Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor 
 at UC Berkeley for the previous 22 years\,  and before that he taught at 
 Harvard\, MIT\, NTU Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five te
 xtbooks and many articles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applica
 tions to optimization\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics an
 d game theory\, the  Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a P
 hD from Princeton (1976)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member
  of the National Academy of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of A
 rts and Sciences\, and the National Academy of Engineering\, and  he has 
 received the Knuth prize\, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as
  well as the 2018 Harvey Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the
  Hellenic republic named him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He h
 as also written three novels: “Turing\,” “Logicomix”  and his lat
 est “Independence.”\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yinscs-disti
