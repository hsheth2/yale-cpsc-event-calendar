 \n\nSpeaker: Rex Ying\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science\n\n“Graph
  Representation Learning: A Geometric Perspective”\n\nAbstract:\nThe tal
 k focuses on geometric embedding approaches to representation learning on 
 graph-structured data. We observe that certain inductive biases of graph d
 ata\, such as hierarchies and transitive closures\, can be modeled more ef
 fectively through different embedding geometries. We leverage hyperbolic e
 mbeddings\, cone embeddings and order embeddings for incorporating these i
 nductive biases of input graph data when learning node and graph represent
 ations for large-scale\, heterogeneous graph data and challenging tasks.\n
 \nSpeaker Bio:\nRex Ying is an assistant professor in the Department of Co
 mputer Science at Yale University. His research focus includes algorithms 
 for graph neural networks\, geometric embeddings\, and trustworthy ML on g
 raphs. He is the author of many widely used GNN algorithms such as GraphSA
 GE\, PinSAGE and GNNExplainer. In addition\, Rex worked on a variety of ap
 plications of graph learning in physical simulations\, social networks\, N
 LP\, knowledge graphs and biology. He developed the first billion-scale gr
 aph embedding services at Pinterest\, and the graph-based anomaly detectio
 n algorithm at Amazon. He is the winner of the dissertation award at KDD 2

SUMMARY:FDS Seminar: Smita Krishnaswamy

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar Series\n\n“Diffusion Earth M
 over’s Distance\, Distribution Embeddings and Flows”\n\nSpeaker: Smita

 \n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a new fast method of measuring distances between
  large numbers of related high dimensional datasets called the Diffusion E
 arth Mover’s Distance (EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supp
 orted on a common data graph that is derived from the affinity matrix comp
 uted on the combined data. In such cases where the graph is a discretizati
 on of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold\, we prove that Diffusion E
 MD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with a geodesic ground 
 distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in {Õ}(n) time and is more accura
 te than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Di
 ffusion EMD is fully differentiable\, making it amenable to future uses in
  gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. We demonstrate 
 an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COV
 ID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here\, Diffusion EMD can
  derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two o
 rders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance mat
 rix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold 
 which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. Finally\, we show 
 DEMD’s incorporation into a neural ode framework we recently developed c
 alled MIOFlow (Manifold Interpolating Flows) for learning dynamics from st
 atic snapshot data. MIOFlow uses an autoencoder with multiscale diffusion 
 distances to find a manifold embedding of data. Then within this latent sp
 ace\, we use the neural network to learn a continuous time derivative to p
 erform dynamic optimal transport of static snapshot measurements of cells 
 and in the process infer continuous dynamics and single-cell trajectories.
  We show results of this in a cancer metastasis system measured using sing
 le-cell RNA-sequencing.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nSmita Krishnaswamy is an Associat
 e Professor in the department of Genetics at the Yale School of Medicine a
 nd Department of Computer Science in the Yale School of Applied Science an
 d Engineering and a core member of the Program in Applied Mathematics. She
  is also affiliated with the Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science\, Yal
 e Cancer Center\, and Program in Interdisciplinary Neuroscience. Smita’s
  research focuses on developing unsupervised machine learning methods (esp
 ecially graph signal processing and deep-learning) to denoise\, impute\, v
 isualize and extract structure\, patterns and relationships from big\, hig
 h throughput\, high dimensional biomedical data. Her methods have been app
 lied variety of datasets from many systems including embryoid body differe
 ntiation\, zebrafish development\, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitio
 n in breast cancer\, lung cancer immunotherapy\, infectious disease data\,
  gut microbiome data and patient data.\n\nSmita teaches three courses: Mac
 hine Learning for Biology (Fall)\, Deep Learning Theory and applications (
 spring)\, Advanced Topics in Machine Learning & Data Mining (Spring). She 
 completed her postdoctoral training at Columbia University in the systems 
 biology department where she focused on learning computational models of c
 ellular signaling from single-cell mass cytometry data. She was trained as
  a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan’s EEC
 S department where her research focused on algorithms for automated synthe
 sis and probabilistic verification of nanoscale logic circuits. Following 
 her time in Michigan\, Smita spent 2 years at IBM’s TJ Watson Research 
  Center as a researcher in the systems division where she worked on autom
 ated bug finding and error correction in logic.\n\nThis presentation will

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n\nRegister to attend the internal launch o
 f Yale’s Institute for Foundations of Data Science (FDS) for a birds-eye
  view of data science at Yale University presented by faculty from across 
 campus.\n\nRegistration open:\nhttp://fds.yale.edu\n\nYale’s Institute f
 or Foundations of Data Science (FDS) for also known as the Kline Tower Ins
 titute\, was created to advance research in the mathematical\, algorithmic
 \, and statistical foundations of data science and their application to ot
 her disciplines. The institute integrates faculty from departments and sch
 ools across the university to help scholars apply new methods of data scie
 nce to their research. In turn\, exposure to the unmet needs of domain sci
 entists inspires advances in foundational research. The institute will hol
 d its activities at varying venues around campus. In August 2023\, FDS wil
 l move into Kline Tower and provide a venue for data scientists to meet\, 
 learn about recent advances\, discover exciting problems\, host visitors\,
  and hold seminars\, workshops\, and conferences.\n\nEvent Schedule:\n\n1
