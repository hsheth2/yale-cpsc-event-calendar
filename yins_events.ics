 cent years have witnessed an explosive growth of Internet of things (IoT) 
 devices\, which collect or generate huge amounts of data. Given diverse de
 vice capabilities and application requirements\, data processing takes pla
 ce across a range of settings\, from on-device to a nearby edge server/clo
 ud and remote cloud. Consequently\, edge-cloud coordination has been studi
 ed extensively from the perspectives of job placement\, scheduling and joi
 nt optimization. Typical approaches focus on performance optimization for 
 individual applications. This often requires domain knowledge of the appli
 cations\, but also leads to application-specific solutions. Application de
 velopment and deployment over diverse scenarios thus incur repetitive manu
 al efforts.\n\nThere are two overarching challenges to provide system-leve
 l support for application development at the edge. First\, there is inhere
 nt heterogeneity at the device hardware level. The execution settings may 
 range from a small cluster as an edge cloud to on-device inference on embe
 dded devices\, differing in hardware capability and programming environmen
 ts. Further\, application performance requirements vary significantly\, ma
 king it even more difficult to map different applications to already heter
 ogeneous hardware. Second\, there are trends towards incorporating edge a
 nd cloud and multi-modal data. Together\, these add further dimensions to
  the design space and increase the complexity significantly.\n\nIn this th
 esis\, we propose a novel framework to simplify application development an
 d deployment over a continuum of edge to cloud. Our framework provides key
  connections between different dimensions of design considerations\, corre
 sponding to the application abstraction\, data abstraction and resource ma
 nagement abstraction respectively.\n\nFirst\, our framework masks hardware
  heterogeneity with abstract resource types through containerization\, and
  abstracts away the application processing pipelines into generic flow gra
 phs. Further\, our framework further supports a notion of degradable compu
 ting for application scenarios at the edge that are involved with multimod
 al sensory input. Next\, we include a generic data management service betw
 een video query systems and a video store to organize video data at the ed
 ge. We propose a video data unit abstraction based on a notion of distance
  between objects in the video\, quantifying the semantic similarity among 
 video data. Last\, considering concurrent application execution\, our fram
 ework supports multi-application offloading with device-centric control\, 
 with a system-level scheduler service that wraps over the operating system
  scheduler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins
