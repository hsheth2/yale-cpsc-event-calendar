DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“A geometrical phenomenon: support vecto
 r machines and linear regression coincides with very high-dimensional feat
 ures”\n\nSpeaker: Navid Ardeshir\n\nAbstract:\nThe support vector machin
 e (SVM) and minimum Euclidean norm least squares regression are two fundam
 entally different approaches to fitting linear models\, but they have rece
 ntly been connected in models for very high-dimensional data (d > n log(n)
 ) through a phenomenon of support vector proliferation\, where every train
 ing example used to fit an SVM becomes a support vector. In this talk I wi
 ll start by connecting these classifiers to the implicit bias of optimizat
 ion procedures trained using certain loss functions\, present a geometrica
 l interpretation of this phenomenon (SVM=OLS)\, and explore the generality
  of it. Furthermore\, I will state some implications of this coincidence o
 n the generalization bounds for maximum margin estimators in certain high 
 dimensional regimes which could not be captured by the existing margin bou
 nds in the literature.  Based on joint works with Clayton Sanford and Dan
 iel Hsu.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nNavid Ardeshir is a third year PhD student in st
 atistics at Columbia University under the supervision of Daniel Hsu and Ar
 ian Maleki. Prior to Columbia\, he completed his bachelor’s in Electrica
 l Engineering at Sharif University in 2019.\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://mathblasp
