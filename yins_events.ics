 Effects of caste-based affirmative action in governance on socio-economic 
 networks and resource provision”\n\n\nSpeaker: Emily Breza\n\nAssistant 
 Professor of Economics\, Harvard University\n\n\nTalk Summary:\nWe study t
 he impacts of political affirmative action for historically disadvantaged 
 caste groups in Bihar\, India on village social and economic networks. The
 se networks shape the socio-economic landscape\, serving many functions su
 ch as facilitating social learning\, risk-sharing and public good provisio
 n. To estimate the causal impacts of the policy\, we conduct surveys in co
 mmunities around the discontinuity in the state government’s policy assi
 gnment rule.\n\nWe have two main findings. First\, the marginal constituen
 cy assigned to the reservation policy experiences a drop in cross-caste ne
 twork links and an increase in homophily. Consistent with increased homoph
 ily\, reservation leads to less social learning when information is introd
 uced to the community – on average there is worse knowledge about health
  preserving behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Further\, the declin
 e in meetings across caste is met with weakened norms about the appropriat
 eness of cross-caste interactions. Second\, we turn to resource access and
  find that the reservation improves access to redistribution schemes as we
 ll as the agility of governmental response to provide resources in respons
 e to shocks. Both lower and upper castes benefited\, indicating no crowd-o
 ut at the expense of upper castes.\n\nStrikingly\, we find no decline in t
 he salience of caste concerns and no shifts in beliefs about trustworthine
 ss\, competence\, or work ethic\, among others\, across caste. So\, the in
 creased homophily is not met with increased animus\; norm shifts are drive
 n by meeting shifts. Our findings suggest that there is scope for pairing 
 reservation with other interventions to mitigate the impacts of affirmativ
 e action on fractionalization while preserving the resource allocation ben
 efits.\n\n(joint with Arun Chandrasekhar and M. R. Sharan)\n\nTo Participa

 Professor in the Economics Department at Harvard University. She received 
 her PhD in Economics from MIT and her BA from Yale University. Prior to jo
 ining Harvard\, Emily held a faculty appointment at Columbia Business Scho
 ol. She has faculty affiliations at the National Bureau of Economic Resear
 ch\, the Jameel Poverty Action Lab\, the International Growth Centre\, and
  the Centre for Economic Policy Research.  She is a 2020 recipient of the
  Sloan Research Fellowship.\n\nHer research focuses on development economi
 cs\, social networks\, and household finance. She has conducted experiment
 s to optimize information disseminate through village social networks in t
 he context of the Indian demonetization and has studied how the social net
 work interacts with the types of formal and informal financial products co
 mmon to developing countries. Emily has also developed empirical methods f
 or measuring socio-economic networks.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/even

SUMMARY:YINS Seminar: Dorsa Sadigh (Stanford)

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Walking the Boundary of Learning and In
 teraction”\n\nSpeaker: Dorsa Sadigh\n\nAssistant Professor\, Computer Sc
 ience and Electrical Engineering\nStanford University\n\nTalk summary:\nTh
 ere have been significant advances in the field of robot learning in the p
 ast decade. However\, many challenges still remain when considering how ro
 bot learning can advance interactive agents such as robots that collaborat
 e with humans\, and how interactions can enable more effective robot learn
 ing. This introduces an opportunity for developing new robot learning algo
 rithms that can help advance interactive autonomy. In this talk\, I will d
 iscuss a formalism for human-robot interaction built upon ideas from repre
 sentation learning. This formalism provides an orthogonal perspective to t
 heory of mind\, and provides a path for scalable partner modeling. Specifi
 cally\, I will first discuss the notion of latent strategies — low dimen
 sional representations sufficient for capturing non-stationary interaction
 s. I will then talk about some of the challenges of learning such represen
 tations when interacting with humans\, and how we can develop data-efficie
 nt techniques that enable actively learning computational models of human 
 behavior from interaction data: demonstrations\, preferences\, or physical
  corrections. Finally\, I will wrap up by discussing some of the challenge
 s that arise when considering long-term repeated interactions\, and how pa
 rtner-specific conventions can be leveraged for fast adaptation on new col
 laborative tasks.\n\nTo participate:\n\nJoin from PC\, Mac\, Linux\, iOS o

 io:\nDorsa Sadigh is an assistant professor in Computer Science and Electr
 ical Engineering at Stanford University.  Her research interests lie in t
 he intersection of robotics\, learning\, and control theory. Specifically\
 , she is interested in developing algorithms for safe and adaptive human-r
 obot interaction. Dorsa has received her doctoral degree in Electrical Eng
 ineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2017\, and has r
 eceived her bachelor’s degree in EECS from UC Berkeley in 2012.  She is
  awarded the NSF CAREER award\, the AFOSR Young Investigator award\, the I
