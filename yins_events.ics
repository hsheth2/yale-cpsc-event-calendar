DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Operationalizing machine learning in re
 al world networks”\n\nSpeaker: Francesco Bronzino\nUniversité Savoie Mo
 nt Blanc\n\nAbstract:\nApplications of machine learning to networking\, fr
 om performance diagnosis to security\, have conventionally relied on model
 s that are trained on offline packet traces\, without regard to the limita
 tions of existing measurement systems nor the cost of gathering\, computin
 g\, and storing the corresponding input features. As a result\, there rema
 ins a significant gap between the development of statistical models for ne
 twork operations and their application and systemization in practice. In t
 his talk\, we explore the challenges of operationalizing machine learning 
 models in real world networks. First\, we develop new models to infer qual
 ity metrics (i.e.\, startup delay and resolution) for encrypted streaming 
 video services and demonstrate the models are practical through a 16-month
  deployment in 66 homes. Building on the lessons learned\, we design and d
 evelop Traffic Refinery\, a new framework and system that enables a joint 
 evaluation of both the conventional notions of machine learning performanc
 e (e.g.\, model accuracy) and the systems-level costs of different represe
 ntations of network traffic. Traffic Refinery makes it possible to explore
  different representations for learning\, balancing systems costs related 
 to feature extraction and model training against model accuracy.\n\nBio: F
 rancesco Bronzino is an Assistant Professor at Université Savoie Mont Bla
 nc. His research interests broadly focus on the Internet infrastructure an
 d the services that populate it\, studying how to leverage emergent techno
 logies to engineer software systems designed to measure and improve networ
 k service performance. His work has been published in top-tier conferences
  such as ACM Sigmetrics\, IEEE/ACM SEC\, and PAM and is currently funded b
 y two national and international ANR awards. Francesco received his Ph.D. 
 in Electrical and Computer Engineering from WINLAB at Rutgers University\,
  working on the design of name based services for future Internet and mobi
 le network architectures. Before joining Université Savoie Mont Blanc\, h
 e was a Research Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs as well as Post-Doctoral res
 earch fellow at Inria Paris\, focusing on network systems for application 
 quality monitoring and inference.\n\nHYBRID SEMINAR: in-person and on Zoom
