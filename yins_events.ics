DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\,\n“Language\, Brain\, and 
 Computation”\n\n\n\nSpeaker: Christos Papadimitriou\n\nAbstract:\nHow d
 oes the brain beget the mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapses effe
 ct reasoning\, intelligence\, language?   Despite dazzling progress in ex
 perimental neuroscience\, as well as in cognitive  science at the other e
 xtreme of scale\, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching 
 question – the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be req
 uired.  As Richard Axel recently put it:  ”We don’t have a logic for
  the transformation  of neural activity into thought […].”       
     What kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?     
       I will introduce a computational system whose basic data structur
 e is the assembly – assemblies are large populations of neurons represen
 ting concepts\, words\, thoughts\, etc. –\, and which is informed by rec
 ent  progress in understanding how language happens in the brain.\n\nSpea
 ker Bio:\nChristos Harilaos Papadimitriou is the Donovan Family Professor 
 of Computer Science at Columbia University.  Before joining Columbia in 2
 017\, he was a professor at UC Berkeley for the previous 22 years\,  and 
 before that he taught at Harvard\, MIT\, NTU Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.
   He has written five textbooks and many articles on algorithms and compl
 exity\, and their applications to optimization\, databases\, control\, AI\
 , robotics\, economics and game theory\, the  Internet\, evolution\, and 
 the brain.  He holds a PhD from Princeton (1976)\, and eight honorary doc
 torates.  He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the US\, 
 the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and the National Academy of En
 gineering\, and  he has received the Knuth prize\, the Go”del prize\, t
 he von Neumann medal\, as well as the 2018 Harvey Prize by Technion.  In 
 2015 the president of the Hellenic republic named him commander of the ord
 er of the Phoenix.  He has also written three novels: “Turing\,” “L
 ogicomix”  and his latest “Independence.”\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.ya
