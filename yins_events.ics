DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Challenges in Reliable Machine Learning
 ”\n\nSpeaker: Kamalika Chaudhuri\n\nAssociate Professor at the Universi
 ty of California\, San Diego\n\nAbstract:\nAs machine learning is increasi
 ngly deployed\, there is a need for reliable and robust methods that go be
 yond simple test accuracy.  In this talk\, we will discuss two challenges
  that arise in reliable machine learning. The first is robustness to adver
 sarial examples\, that are small imperceptible perturbations to legitimate
  test inputs that cause machine learning classifiers to misclassify. While
  recent work has proposed many attacks and defenses\, why exactly they ari
 se still remains a mystery. In this talk\, we’ll take a closer look at t
 his question.\n\nThe second problem is overfitting\, that many generative 
 models are known to be prone to. Motivated by privacy concerns\, we formal
 ize a form of overfitting that we call data-copying – where the generati
 ve model memorizes and outputs training samples or small variations thereo
 f. We provide a three sample test for detecting data-copying\, and study t
 he performance of our test on several canonical models and datasets.\n\nTo

  is currently an Associate Professor at the University of California\, San
  Diego. She received a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science a
 nd Engineering in 2002 from Indian Institute of Technology\, Kanpur\, and 
 a PhD in Computer Science from University of California at Berkeley in 200
 7. After a postdoctoral stint at UCSD\, she joined the CSE department at U
 C San Diego as an assistant professor in 2010. She received an NSF CAREER 
 Award in 2013 and a Hellman Faculty Fellowship in 2012. She has served as 
 the program co-chair for AISTATS 2019 and ICML 2019.\n\nKamalika’s resea
 rch interests lie in the foundations of trustworthy machine learning – o
 r machine learning beyond accuracy\, which includes problems such as learn
 ing from sensitive data while preserving privacy\, learning under sampling
  bias\, and in the presence of an adversary.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.e

SUMMARY:YINS Seminar: Mehryar Mohri (NYU)
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210310T170000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210310T180000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Adaptation and Federated Learning”\n\
 nSpeaker: Mehryar Mohri\n\nProfessor of Computer Science and Mathematics\,
  New York University\n\n\nTalk summary:\nFederated learning is a prominent
  new learning scenario in large-scale applications\, where a centralized m
 odel is trained based on data originating from a large number of clients. 
 But\, how can learning be successful with heterogenous client distribution
 s? This talk discusses fundamental theoretical and algorithmic solutions f
 or several variants of this problem.\n\nTo participate:\n\nJoin from PC\,
