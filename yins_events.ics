DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\,\n“\nBoosting for Online C
 onvex Optimization”\n\nSpeaker: Karan Singh\n\nPostdoc\, Princeton Unive
 rsity\n\nTalk summary:\nBoosting is a computational framework for composit
 ional learning. There are two traditions to the theory of boosting. First:
  Classical boosting\, arising from theoretical CS\, converts weak slightly
 -better-than-random learners to an accurate one\, enhancing the accuracy. 
 Originally designed for the binary classification setting\, the literature
  on boosting was extended to multi-class\, multi-label\, and ranking-based
  settings (all examples of linear loss) with specialized constructions in 
 each case. Second: Gradient boosting\, on the other hand\, aggregates simp
 le (but accurate) learners into a more expressive one\; it guarantees comp
 etitiveness with the convex hull of the weak hypothesis class.  The main 
 contribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enhances the accu
 racy and expressivity of the learning process at the same time\, while ope
 rating on general convex loss (vs. linear for classical boosting) and any 
 convex decision set. This resultant excess risk (average regret) guarantee
  unifies and delivers on the twin objectives of classical boosting and gra
 dient boosting. The reduction holds for both the (non-stochastic) online a
 nd statistical settings\, and is amenable to bandit feedback.\n\nTo partic

 ral researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond. He received a PhD in Comp
 uter Science\, under the supervision of Prof. Elad Hazan\, from Princeton 
 University in 2021. His research looks at questions in supervised and inte
 ractive learning through the lens of optimization. This has\, in recent ye
 ars\, shaped into a quest towards an algorithmic (vs. traditionally\, anal
 ytic) foundation for control theory\, for learning in dynamical systems th
 at do not “forget”\, and for provably sound mechanisms of compositiona
 l learning.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yins-seminar-karan-singh
