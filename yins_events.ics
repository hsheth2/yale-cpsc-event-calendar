 e-hop scheduling for throughput maximization”\n\nSpeaker: Nikolaos (Niko
 s) Papadis\n\nAbstract:\nPermissionless blockchains like Bitcoin achieve l
 ow throughput\, being able to process only a few transactions per second. 
 Payment channel networks (PCNs) such as Lightning have emerged as a scalab
 ility solution for blockchains built on the concept of a payment channel: 
 a setting that allows two parties to safely transact between themselves in
  high frequencies by updating pre-committed balances. Transaction requests
  in PCNs may be declined because of unavailability of funds due to tempora
 ry uneven distribution of the channel balances. In this presentation\, we 
 investigate how to alleviate unnecessary payment blockage via proper prior
 itization of the transaction execution order. Specifically\, we consider t
 he scheduling problem in a payment channel: as transactions continuously a
 rrive on both sides\, nodes need to decide which ones to process and when\
 , in order to maximize channel throughput. We introduce a stochastic model
  to capture the dynamics of a payment channel under discrete stochastic ar
 rivals\, with incoming transactions potentially held in buffers up until s
 ome deadline in order to enable more elaborate processing decisions. We de
 scribe a scheduling policy that maximizes the channel success rate/through
 put\, formally prove its optimality for fixed-amount transactions\, and al
 so show its superiority in the case of heterogeneous amounts via experimen
 ts in our discrete event simulator. The relevant paper will appear in INFO
 COM 2022.\n\nBio:\nNikolaos (Nikos) Papadis is currently a Ph.D. student a

 oud-Native RANs”\n\nSpeaker: Akrit Mudvari\n\nAbstract:\nAs the containe
 rization of network services moves towards the Radio Access Network (RAN)\
 , the operators seek to benefit from the paradigm of cloud-native services
  through a wide ecosystem of practices that are applicable to such resourc
 es. Such practices include the dynamic scaling of the services in response
  to the demand\, with the network service being assigned more/less resourc
 es\, or replicated\, for accommodating the incoming demand. In such cloud-
 native environments\, proactive decisions can be accomplished through Mach
 ine Learning models\, that are efficiently trained for specific metrics th
 at reflect the network demand. In this work\, we use a real cloud-native t
 elecommunications network and real traffic patterns\, and evaluate four di
 fferent Machine Learning methods for predicting the incoming demand. The d
 ecisions made based on the predictions regard the scaling of the base stat
 ion (gNB/eNB) and the core network entities that deal with the User-Plane 
 traffic (UPF/SPGW-U). Our results show that higher accuracy for such predi
 ctions can be accomplished using the tree-based methods over the Neural Ne
 twork-based solutions\, when each method is used for making accurate proac
 tive decisions for scaling of the under-study network functions.\n\nBio:\n

  and Physics\, and he has worked as a research intern at Bell labs. His re
 search interests include investigating how machine learning methods can be
  used to improve various aspects of next generation communication methods.
 \n\n“Exact solvers for the alternative fuel refueling station location p
 roblem with routing and station capacity constraints”\n\nSpeaker: Nichol
 as Nordlund\n\nAbstract:\nTransportation accounts for 29% of greenhouse ga
 s emissions in the USA. As a result\, logistics companies like Amazon have
  begun moving away from diesel trucks and towards alternative fuel vehicle
 s (AFVs). While the transition to AFVs will reduce greenhouse gas emission
 s\, it can also negatively impact services. Alternative refueling stations
  are more sparsely located and refueling times are significantly longer fo
 r AFVs compared to their diesel counterparts. These increases can result i
 n higher transit times and larger shipping delays for packages in the tran
 sportation network. This transportation network consists of origin/destina
 tion warehouses with package demand flows between them\, a set of candidat
 e locations for new refueling stations\, and range-limited AFVs. In this t
 alk\, we will discuss the design of scalable exact solving algorithms that
  build the minimum number of new refueling stations to transport all deman
 d without intolerable increases in package delay. For our exact solvers\, 
 we compare row generation and column generation techniques.\n\nBio:\nNicho

 ource allocation problems in cloud scheduling and transportation networks.
 \n\n“Robust machine learning aided viewport prediction in virtual realit
 y”\n\nSpeaker: Yuang Jiang\n\nAbstract:\n360-degree panoramic videos hav
 e gained considerable attention in recent years due to the rapid advance i
 n head-mounted devices and panoramic cameras. One major problem in panoram
 ic video streaming is that panoramic videos are much larger in size compar
 ed with traditional videos\, and usually have high resolution. Moreover\, 
 the user devices are often in a wireless environment\, with limited batter
 y\, computation power and bandwidth. To reduce the resource consumption\, 
 researchers have proposed various approaches to predict the users’ viewp
 orts so that only part of the entire video needs to be transmitted from th
 e server. However\, the robustness of such prediction approaches has been 
 largely overlooked in the literature: it is usually assumed that a single 
 universal model\, trained on past users’ experience\, is applied for pre
 diction to all users. We observe that this single model can perform poorly
  to some users since they might have drastically different behaviors from 
 the majority. In this work\, we propose a meta learning based approach to 
 alleviate the worst performance and ensure the robustness of viewport pred
 iction. To do so\, we first train a meta model that is sensitive to new tr
 aining data\, and then quickly adapt this meta model to users while they a
 re viewing the video. Evaluation results reveal that our approach can adap
 t quickly to each user\, and can significantly increase the prediction acc
 uracy\, especially for the outliers.\n\nBio:\nYuang Jiang received the B.S
 . degree in applied physics and B.E. degree in computer science from Unive
 rsity of Science and Technology of China in 2016. Advised by Prof. Leandro
 s Tassiulas\, he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Departmen
 t of Electrical Engineering\, Yale University. His research includes the d
 esign and implementation of the resource allocation algorithms in networke
 d systems\, including edge devices\, virtual reality systems and datacente
 rs.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/meet-yins-tassiulas-lab

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Operationalizing machine learning in re
 al world networks”\n\nSpeaker: Francesco Bronzino\nUniversité Savoie Mo
 nt Blanc\n\nAbstract:\nApplications of machine learning to networking\, fr
 om performance diagnosis to security\, have conventionally relied on model
 s that are trained on offline packet traces\, without regard to the limita
 tions of existing measurement systems nor the cost of gathering\, computin
 g\, and storing the corresponding input features. As a result\, there rema
 ins a significant gap between the development of statistical models for ne
 twork operations and their application and systemization in practice. In t
 his talk\, we explore the challenges of operationalizing machine learning 
 models in real world networks. First\, we develop new models to infer qual
 ity metrics (i.e.\, startup delay and resolution) for encrypted streaming 
 video services and demonstrate the models are practical through a 16-month
  deployment in 66 homes. Building on the lessons learned\, we design and d
 evelop Traffic Refinery\, a new framework and system that enables a joint 
 evaluation of both the conventional notions of machine learning performanc
 e (e.g.\, model accuracy) and the systems-level costs of different represe
 ntations of network traffic. Traffic Refinery makes it possible to explore
  different representations for learning\, balancing systems costs related 
 to feature extraction and model training against model accuracy.\n\nBio: F
 rancesco Bronzino is an Assistant Professor at Université Savoie Mont Bla
