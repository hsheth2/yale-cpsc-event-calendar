 mind?  How do molecules\, cells and synapses effect reasoning\, intellige
 nce\, language?   Despite dazzling progress in experimental neuroscience\
 , as well as in cognitive  science at the other extreme of scale\, we do 
 not seem to be making progress in the overarching question – the gap is 
 huge and a completely new approach seems to be required.  As Richard Axel
  recently put it:  ”We don’t have a logic for the transformation  of
  neural activity into thought […].”           What kind of formal
  system would qualify as this “logic”?           I will introduce
  a computational system whose basic data structure is the assembly – ass
 emblies are large populations of neurons representing concepts\, words\, t
 houghts\, etc. –\, and which is informed by recent  progress in underst
 anding how language happens in the brain.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nChristos Harila
 os Papadimitriou is the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Co
 lumbia University.  Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he was a professor 
 at UC Berkeley for the previous 22 years\,  and before that he taught at 
 Harvard\, MIT\, NTU Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five te
 xtbooks and many articles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applica
 tions to optimization\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics an
 d game theory\, the  Internet\, evolution\, and the brain.  He holds a P
 hD from Princeton (1976)\, and eight honorary doctorates.  He is a member
  of the National Academy of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of A
 rts and Sciences\, and the National Academy of Engineering\, and  he has 
 received the Knuth prize\, the Go”del prize\, the von Neumann medal\, as
  well as the 2018 Harvey Prize by Technion.  In 2015 the president of the
  Hellenic republic named him commander of the order of the Phoenix.  He h
 as also written three novels: “Turing\,” “Logicomix”  and his lat
 est “Independence.”\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yinscs-disti
