 ective on Coresets\n\nAbstract\n: Coresets have emerged as a powerful tool
  to summarize data by selecting a small subset of the original observation
 s while retaining most of its information. This approach has led to signif
 icant computational speedups\, but the statistical performance of procedur
 es run on coresets is largely unexplored. I will introduce a statistical f
 ramework to study coresets and focus on the task of nonparametric density 
 estimation. Then I will characterize the statistical performance of corese
 t-based estimators and show that the practical coreset kernel density esti
 mators are near-minimax optimal.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n: Paxton Turner is a fift
 h year Ph.D. student in the department of mathematics at MIT\, advised by 
 Philippe Rigollet. His research interests span statistics\, algorithms\, a
 nd theoretical aspects of machine learning. Before coming to MIT\, he did 
 his undergraduate studies in mathematics at Louisiana State University.\n\
