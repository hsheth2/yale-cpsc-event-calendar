DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar: Yuchen Wu\n\n“Fundamental L
 imits of Low-Rank Matrix Estimation: Information-Theoretic and Computation
 al Perspectives”\n\nSpeaker: Yuchen Wu\nStanford University\n\nWebcast\n
 \nAbstract:\nMany statistical estimation problems can be reduced to the re
 construction of a low-rank n×d matrix when observed through a noisy chann
 el. While tremendous positive results have been established\, relatively f
 ew works focus on understanding the fundamental limitations of the propose
 d models and algorithms. Understanding such limitations not only provides 
 practitioners with guidance on algorithm selection\, but also spurs the de
 velopment of cutting-edge methodologies.   In this talk\, I will present 
 some recent progress in this direction from two perspectives in the contex
 t of low-rank matrix estimation. From an information-theoretic perspective
 \, I will give an exact characterization of the limiting minimum estimatio
 n error. Our results apply to the high-dimensional regime n\,d→∞ and d
 /n→∞ (or d/n→0) and generalize earlier works that focus on the propo
 rtional asymptotics n\,d→∞\, d/n→δ∈(0\,∞). From an algorithmic 
 perspective\, large-dimensional matrices are often processed by iterative 
 algorithms like power iteration and gradient descent\, thus encouraging th
 e pursuit of understanding the fundamental limits of these approaches. We 
 introduce a class of general first order methods (GFOM)\, which is broad e
 nough to include the aforementioned algorithms and many others. I will des
 cribe the asymptotic behavior of any GFOM\, and provide a sharp characteri
 zation of the optimal error achieved by the GFOM class.\n\nThis is based o
 n joint works with Michael Celentano and Andrea Montanari.\n\nAdd event to

SUMMARY:FDS Seminar: Aditi Laddha

DTEND:20221216T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar: Aditi Laddha\n\n“High-Dime
 nsional Markov Chains and Applications”\n\nSpeaker: Aditi Laddha\n\nWeb
 cast.\n\nAbstract:\nA Markov chain is a random process in which the next s
 tate is chosen according to some probability distribution that depends onl
 y on the current state. In a high-dimensional setting\, Markov chains are 
 essential tools for understanding the geometry of the space and form the b
 ackbone of many efficient randomized algorithms for tasks like optimizatio
 n\, integration\, linear programming\, approximate counting\, etc. In this
  talk\, I will provide an overview of my research on “High-Dimensional M
 arkov Chains\,” with a focus on the geometric aspects of the chains.\n\n
 I will describe two results that illustrate the importance of Markov chain
 s for designing efficient algorithms. First\, I will discuss my work on a 
 barrier-based random walk for bounding the discrepancy of set systems. I w
 ill then present a general framework for bounding discrepancy in various s
 ettings. Second\, I will describe two Markov chains\, the Weighted Dikin W
 alk and Coordinate Hit-and-Run for sampling convex bodies\, and discuss ne
 w techniques for bounding their convergence rates.    You are invited to
  a scheduled Zoom meeting. Zoom is Yale’s audio and visual conferencing 
 platform.    Topic: FDS Seminar: Aditi Laddha  Time: Dec 16\, 2022 03:0
