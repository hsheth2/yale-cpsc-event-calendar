DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Computational Hardness of Hypothesis Te
 sting and Quiet Plantings”\n\nSpeaker: Afonso S. Bandeira\n\nProfessor o
 f Mathematics\, ETH Zürich\n\nTalk summary:\nWhen faced with a data analy
 sis\, learning\, or statistical inference problem\, the amount and quality
  of data available fundamentally determines whether such tasks can be perf
 ormed with certain levels of accuracy. With the growing size of datasets h
 owever\, it is crucial not only that the underlying statistical task is po
 ssible\, but also that is doable by means of efficient algorithms. In this
  talk we will discuss methods aiming to establish limits of when statistic
 al tasks are possible with computationally efficient methods or when there
  is a fundamental «Statistical-to-Computational gap›› in which an inf
 erence task is statistically possible but inherently computationally hard.
  We will focus on Hypothesis Testing and the “Low Degree Method” and a
 lso address hardness of certification via “quiet plantings”. Guiding e
 xamples will include Sparse PCA\, bounds on the Sherrington Kirkpatrick Ha
 miltonian\, and lower bounds on Chromatic Numbers of random graphs.\n\nTo

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Graph Representation Learning: Recent A
 dvances and Open Challenges”\n\nSpeaker: William L. Hamilton\n\nAssistan
 t Professor\, School of Computer Science\, McGill University\n\nTalk Summa
 ry:\nGraph-structured data is ubiquitous throughout the natural and social
  sciences\, from telecommunication networks to quantum chemistry. Building
  relational inductive biases into deep learning architectures is crucial i
 f we want systems that can learn\, reason\, and generalize from this kind 
 of data. Recent years have seen a surge in research on graph representatio
 n learning\, most prominently in the development of graph neural networks 
 (GNNs). Advances in GNNs have led to state-of-the-art results in numerous 
 domains\, including chemical synthesis\, 3D-vision\, recommender systems\,
  question answering\, and social network analysis. In the first part of th
 is talk I will provide an overview and summary of recent progress in this 
 fast-growing area\, highlighting foundational methods and theoretical moti
 vations. In the second part of this talk I will discuss fundamental limita
 tions of the current GNN paradigm. Finally\, I will conclude the talk by d
 iscussing recent progress my group has made in advancing graph representat
 ion learning beyond the GNN paradigm.\n\nTo participate:\nJoin from PC\, M

 n the School of Computer Science at McGill University\, a Canada CIFAR AI 
 Chair\, and a member of the Mila AI Institute of Quebec. Will completed hi
 s PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in 2018. He received the 
 2018 Arthur Samuel Thesis Award for best Computer Science PhD Thesis from 
 Stanford University\, the 2014 CAIAC MSc Thesis Award for best AI-themed M
 Sc thesis in Canada\, as well as an honorable mention for the 2013 ACM Und
 ergraduate Researcher of the Year. His interests lie at the intersection o
 f machine learning\, network science\, and natural language processing\, w
 ith a current emphasis on the fast-growing subject of graph representation
  learning.\n\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yins-seminar-will-hamilton-m
