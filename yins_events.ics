DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar:\n“Wasserstein Distribution
 ally Robust Optimization: Theory and Applications in Machine Learning”\n
 \nSpeaker: Daniel Kuhn (EPFL)\n\nChair of Risk Analytics and Optimization 
 at EPFL\n\nAbstract:\nMany decision problems in science\, engineering and 
 economics are affected by uncertain parameters whose distribution is only 
 indirectly observable through samples. The goal of data-driven decision-ma
 king is to learn a decision from finitely many training samples that will 
 perform well on unseen test samples. This learning task is difficult even 
 if all training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution - es
 pecially if the dimension of the uncertainty is large relative to the trai
 ning sample size. Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization seeks d
 ata-driven decisions that perform well under the most adverse distribution
  within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution constru
 cted from the training samples. In this talk we will see that this approac
 h has many conceptual and computational benefits. Most prominently\, the o
 ptimal decisions can often be computed by solving tractable convex optimiz
 ation problems\, and they enjoy rigorous out-of-sample and asymptotic cons
 istency guarantees. We will also show that Wasserstein distributionally ro
 bust optimization has interesting ramifications for statistical learning a
 nd motivates new approaches for fundamental learning tasks such as classif
 ication\, regression\, maximum likelihood estimation or minimum mean squar
 e error estimation\, among others.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nDaniel Kuhn holds the 
 Chair of Risk Analytics and Optimization at EPFL. Before joining EPFL\, he
  was a faculty member at Imperial College London (2007-2013) and a postdoc
 toral researcher at Stanford University (2005-2006). He received a PhD in 
 Economics from the University of St. Gallen in 2004 and an MSc in Theoreti
 cal Physics from ETH Zurich in 1999. His research interests revolve around
  robust optimization and stochastic programming.\n\nTo participate:\nJoin

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“Contrastive learning\, 
 multi-view redundancy\, and linear models”\n\nSpeaker: Daniel Hsu\n\nCol
 umbia University\n\nAbstract:\nContrastive learning is a “self-supervise
 d” approach to representation learning that uses naturally occurring sim
 ilar and dissimilar pairs of data points to find useful embeddings of data
 . We study contrastive learning in the context of multi-view statistical m
 odels. First\, we show that whenever the views of the data are approximate
 ly redundant in their ability to predict a target function\, a low-dimensi
 onal embedding obtained via contrastive learning affords a linear predicto
 r with near-optimal predictive accuracy. Second\, we show that in the cont
 ext of topic models\, the embedding can be interpreted as a linear transfo
 rmation of the posterior moments of the hidden topic distribution given th
 e observed words. We also empirically demonstrate that linear classifiers 
 with these representations perform well in document classification tasks w
 ith very few labeled examples in a semi-supervised setting.\n\nThis is joi
 nt work with Akshay Krishnamurthy (MSR) and Christopher Tosh (Columbia).\n
 \nSpeaker Bio:\nDaniel Hsu is an associate professor in the Department of 
 Computer Science and a member of the Data Science Institute\, both at Colu
 mbia University. Previously\, he was a postdoc at Microsoft Research New E
 ngland\, and the Departments of Statistics at Rutgers University and the U
 niversity of Pennsylvania. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Sa
 n Diego\, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley.
  He was selected by IEEE Intelligent Systems as one of “AI’s 10 to Wat
 ch” in 2015 and received a 2016 Sloan Research Fellowship. Daniel’s re
 search interests are in algorithmic statistics and machine learning.\n\nTo

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS/EE Seminar\n\n“Advanced and Coordin
 ated Inverter Control for a Secure Electrical Grid with High Penetrations 
 of Renewables”\n\nSpeaker:\nPanayiotis (Panos) Moutis\, PhD\n\nSpecial F
 aculty with the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon U
 niversity (CMU)\n\nAbstract:\nThe main reason an electrical grid collapses
  is the disruption of the generation-demand balance\; i.e.\, not enough ge
 neration for all loads or no electrical paths (energy flow through wires) 
 for that reason. Until recently\, conventional energy sources that were sp
 inning physical generator rotors\, represented considerable inertia\, whic
 h would limit the effects of generation-demand imbalances and keep them ma
 nageable by the system. As renewables have been steadily increasing and\, 
 thus\, displacing conventional units\, they have also been displacing the 
 inertia of the latter\, which the former cannot replace. This is because r
 enewables are electromechanically decoupled from the grid through inverter
 s or because they do not possess physical inertia in the first place. More
 over\, the inverters themselves incorporate controls of varying time frame
 s that may resonate with internal and grid impedances\, thus\, requiring a
 ppropriate tuning to damp oscillatory behaviors (at the very least). In th
 e first part of this seminar\, we discuss control methods that enable wind
  generators and photovoltaics to take up on the role of conventional resou
 rces in preserving the generation-demand balance. Results of real-world te
 sting prove that the technology is mature and applicability is readily fea
 sible. In the second part\, we review the major concerns on the stability 
 of an electrical grid with high penetrations of inverter-interfaced resour
 ces and how these concerns define a path of research for coordinated activ
 e control. As it will be demonstrated\, the new control paradigm will requ
 ire grid monitoring of high accuracy and time granularity of sub-second sc
 ale. We will conclude with a discussion on the challenges in the path forw
 ard for an inverter-dominated electrical grid.\n\nTo participate:\n\nJoin
