DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Strong Duality in Risk-C
 onstrained Nonconvex Functional Programming”\n\nSpeaker: Dionysis Kaloge
 rias\nAssistant Professor\, Electrical Engineering\, Yale University\n\nAb
 stract:\nFunctional programming (also known as policy optimization/search)
  appears naturally in situations where optimal decisions are needed on the
  basis of observed information.  Such problems arise across a variety of 
 disciplines\, e.g.\, machine/reinforcement learning (predictors/classifier
 s/controllers are policies)\, estimation and control\, finance/economics\,
  and networking/communications. At the same time\, functional (i.e.\, poli
 cy-related) constraints are desirable in modern applications\, due to the 
 need to induce robustness\, fairness\, safety\, and more generally trustwo
 rthiness in policy design\, which if remain unconstrained can reportedly r
 esult in highly undesirable or even catastrophic outcomes. Popular related
  areas include fair learning\, safe reinforcement learning\, adversarial l
 earning\, constrained estimation/control and constrained MDPs\, robust res
 ource allocation\, and others.\n\nAlthough sometimes it may be possible to
  get away with convex (re)formulations\, intrinsic nonconvexity is prevale
 nt in most such problems\, and the prominent framework of Lagrangian duali
 ty\, which would enable rigorous scalarization of constraints\, does not w
 ork in general. Nevertheless\, it has been shown that strong duality indee
 d holds for expectation-constrained\, arbitrarily nonconvex functional pro
 grams\, under standard assumptions. This is remarkable and far-reaching\, 
 and is a consequence of standard (though deep) facts in convex geometry. H
 owever\, expectation constraints are by construction inadequate to capture
  risky events\, which are related to the statistical variability\, dispers
 ion or (fat) tail behavior of the randomness involved in applications\; pr
 operly treating such randomness is key in ensuring trustworthiness. Instea
 d\, risky behavior is quantified by certain nonlinear generalizations of t
 he expectation functional\, called risk measures\, but such functionals on
 ce again challenge the applicability of Lagrangian duality in the context 
 of constrained programming.\n\nIn this talk\, we show that\, under the sam
 e assumptions\, risk-constrained functional optimization problems with gen
 eral integrable nonconvex instantaneous reward functions also exhibit stro
 ng duality\, regardless of nonconvexity. We consider risk constraints base
 d on convex and positively homogeneous risk measures (evaluating those non
 convex rewards and) admitting dual representations with bounded risk envel
 opes\, strictly generalizing expectations. Beyond expectations\, very popu
 lar risk measures supported within our setting include the conditional val
 ue-at-risk (CVaR)\, the mean-absolute deviation (including the non-monoton
 e case)\, certain distributionally robust representations and more general
 ly all real-valued coherent risk measures on the space of integrable funct
 ions L1. Our proof technique is new and relies on risk conjugate duality i
 n tandem with J. J. Uhl’s weak extension of A. A. Lyapunov’s convexity
  theorem for vector measures taking values in general infinite-dimensional
  Banach spaces. A preprint of this work –soon to be submitted– may be 
 found on arXiv:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11948\n\nSpeaker bio:\nDionysi

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“A Tale of Two Networks:
  Common Ownership and Product Market Rivalry”\n\nSpeaker: Florian Ederer
 \nAssociate Professor of Economics\, Yale School of Management\n\n\n\nAbst
 ract:\nWe study the welfare implications of the rise of common ownership i
 n the United States from 1994 to 2018. We build a general equilibrium mode
 l with a hedonic demand system in which firms compete in a network game of
  oligopoly. Firms are connected through two large networks: the first refl
 ects ownership overlap\, the second product market rivalry. In our model\,
  common ownership of competing firms induces unilateral incentives to soft
 en competition. The magnitude of the common ownership effect depends on ho
 w much the two networks overlap. We estimate our model for the universe of
  U.S. public corporations using a combination of firm financials\, investo
 r holdings\, and text-based product similarity data. We perform counterfac
 tual calculations to evaluate how the efficiency and the distributional im
 pact of common ownership have evolved over time. According to our baseline
  estimates the welfare cost of common ownership\, measured as the ratio of
  deadweight loss to total surplus\, has increased nearly tenfold (from 0.3
 % to over 4%) between 1994 and 2018. Under alternative assumptions about g
 overnance\, the deadweight loss ranges between 1.9% and 4.4% of total surp
 lus in 2018. The rise of common ownership has also resulted in a significa
 nt reallocation of surplus from consumers to producers.\n\n\n\nhttps://www

 e Professor of Economics at the Yale School of Management\, a Research Sta
 ff Member at the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics\, and an NBER
  faculty research fellow. Professor Ederer’s research\, which has been w
 idely published in leading journals\, is in the areas of organizational ec
 onomics\, innovation\, and antitrust. Some of his recent work explores the
  impact of networks of common ownership on managerial compensation and pro
 duct market competition and the existence and pervasiveness of “killer a
 cquisitions” that prevent startups from challenging dominant market incu
 mbents. In his academic work he draws on a broad set of tools often combin
 ing theoretical models\, experimental methods\, and empirical analysis. Pr
 ior to joining the Yale School of Management Professor Ederer was a facult
 y member of the UCLA Anderson School of Management. He earned his doctorat
 e in economics at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology and his maste
 r’s and undergraduate degrees from the University of Oxford.\n\n\n\nThis

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Convex Analysis at Infin
 ity: An Introduction to Astral Space”\n\nSpeaker: Robert Schapire\nMicr
 osoft Research\n\nAbstract:\nNot all convex functions have finite minimize
 rs\; some can only be minimized by a sequence as it heads to infinity.  I
 n this work\, we aim to develop a theory for understanding such minimizers
  at infinity.  We study\nastral space\n\, a compact extension of Euclidea
 n space to which such points at infinity have been added.  Astral space i
 s constructed to be as small as possible while still ensuring that all lin
 ear functions can be continuously extended to the new space.  Although no
 t a vector space\, nor even a metric space\, astral space is nevertheless 
 so well-structured as to allow useful and meaningful extensions of such co
 ncepts as convexity\, conjugacy\, and subdifferentials.  We develop these
  concepts and analyze various properties of convex functions on astral spa
 ce\, including the detailed structure of their minimizers\, exact characte
 rizations of continuity\, and convergence of descent algorithms.\n\nThis i
 s joint work with Miroslav Dudík and Matus Telgarsky.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nRo
 bert Schapire is a Partner Researcher at Microsoft Research in New York Ci
 ty.  He received his PhD from MIT in 1991.  After a short postdoc at Har
 vard\, he joined the technical staff at AT&T Labs (formerly AT&T Bell Labo
 ratories) in 1991.  In 2002\, he became a Professor of Computer Science 
 at Princeton University.  He joined Microsoft Research in 2014.  His aw
 ards include the 1991 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award\, the 2003 Gödel Pr
 ize\, and the 2004 Kanelakkis Theory and Practice Award (both of the last 
 two with Yoav Freund).  He is a fellow of the AAAI\, and a member of both
  the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences
