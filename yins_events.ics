 n\nTalk summary:\nThis talk presents a variational framework to understand
  the properties of functions learned by neural networks fit to data. The f
 ramework is based on total variation semi-norms defined in the Radon domai
 n\, which is naturally suited to the analysis of neural activation functio
 ns (ridge functions). Finding a function that fits a dataset while having 
 a small semi-norm is posed as an infinite dimensional variational optimiza
 tion.  We derive a representer theorem showing that finite-width neural n
 etworks are solutions to the variational problem. The representer theorem 
 is reminiscent of the classical reproducing kernel Hilbert space represent
 er theorem\, but we show that neural networks are solutions in a non-Hilbe
 rtian Banach space. While the learning problems are posed in an infinite d
 imensional function space\, similar to kernel methods\, they can be recast
  as finite-dimensional neural network training problems. These neural netw
 ork training problems have regularizers which are related to the well-know
 n weight decay and path-norm regularizers. Thus\, the results provide new 
 insight into functional characteristics of overparameterized neural networ
 ks and also into the design neural network regularizers.  Our results als
 o provide new theoretical support for a number of empirical findings in de
 ep learning architectures including the benefits of “skip connections”
 \, sparsity\, and low-rank structures.\n\nThis is joint work with Rahul Pa
