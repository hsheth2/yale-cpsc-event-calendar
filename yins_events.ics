DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Convex Analysis at Infin
 ity: An Introduction to Astral Space”\n\nSpeaker: Robert Schapire\nMicr
 osoft Research\n\nAbstract:\nNot all convex functions have finite minimize
 rs\; some can only be minimized by a sequence as it heads to infinity.  I
 n this work\, we aim to develop a theory for understanding such minimizers
  at infinity.  We study\nastral space\n\, a compact extension of Euclidea
 n space to which such points at infinity have been added.  Astral space i
 s constructed to be as small as possible while still ensuring that all lin
 ear functions can be continuously extended to the new space.  Although no
 t a vector space\, nor even a metric space\, astral space is nevertheless 
 so well-structured as to allow useful and meaningful extensions of such co
 ncepts as convexity\, conjugacy\, and subdifferentials.  We develop these
  concepts and analyze various properties of convex functions on astral spa
 ce\, including the detailed structure of their minimizers\, exact characte
 rizations of continuity\, and convergence of descent algorithms.\n\nThis i
 s joint work with Miroslav Dudík and Matus Telgarsky.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nRo

  graph-neural networks for brain dynamics and spatial genomics\n\nGraph-ne
 ural networks (or geometric deep learning) are revolutionizing machine lea
 rning and data science. They combine ideas from graph theory\, geometry\, 
 topology\, and deep learning to learn powerful non-linear models on graphi
 cal data. In the Van Dijk Lab we are developing several new types of graph
  neural networks\, based on ideas from dynamical systems\, computer vision
 \, and natural language processing\, and apply these to diverse biomedical
  applications. In one application\, we are using graph neural networks to 
 model spatiotemporal brain activity data\, such as whole-cortex calcium im
 aging and fMRI recordings. In a second application\, we are using graph ne
 ural networks to model spatial transcriptomic data – a new technology fo
 r the measurement of high-dimensional gene expression at the single-cell l
 evel with spatial resolution. Using our algorithm\, we infer cell-cell int
 eractions in measurements from kidney cancer and brain tissue of multiple 
 sclerosis patients. In these projects\, there is the opportunity to focus 
 more on the algorithmic side or on the application\, and you will work clo
 sely with postdocs and grad students in the lab.\n\nMark Gerstein\nAlbert

 rently approaching the broad topic of genome privacy and security from two
  different angles. First\, we are trying to assess the risks presented by 
 public genome databases and other genomic information floating around to i
 ndividuals. We are interested in coming up with ways to quantify the infor
 mation leakage in different scenarios\, such as how many SNPs would be nee
 ded at minimum to identify a person accurately from a DNA sample taken fro
 m a coffee cup they recently left behind. Second\, we are evaluating the p
 erformance of different techniques to enable privacy-preserving genome ana
 lysis on cloud computing environments such as AWS\, Azure\, and Google Clo
 ud Platform. These techniques include Homomorphic Encryption\, Secure Mult
 iparty Computing\, and Trusted Execution Environments such as the Intel SG
 X. Each of these techniques involve certain advantages and disadvantages c
 ompared to the others when it comes to security and protection guarantees 
 and strength\, runtime performance\, ease-of-use\, etc. We are always tryi
 ng to come up with efficient algorithms and data structures that allow the
  use of these techniques to aid with core bioinformatics tasks such as gen
 otype imputation and genome-wide association studies.\n\nJulian Posada\nIn

  Availability of Online Data Work\n\nMany organizations that develop data-
 intensive technologies outsource data generation\, annotation\, and verifi
 cation processes through online platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk\, Re
 motasks\, and Appen. Data workers are an invisible population because plat
 form companies often conceal information about their contractual workers t
 o researchers. Other options to study this invisible population using comp
 utational social research methods exist\, including analyzing web traffic 
 data to understand the geography of data work. This talk presents an ongoi
 ng project to study the coloniality of data work\, a crucial step in under
 standing the social conditions in which many data sets are developed. The 
 preliminary results show the existence of a North-South divide in data pro
 duction\, in which most of the demand for data work comes from the United 
 States and the supply from a handful of countries with particular social\,
  economic\, and infrastructural conditions. I collected web traffic data f
 rom 93 platforms in 2019-2021 and found that most of the workers’ traffi
 c comes from Venezuela\, a country experiencing the highest levels of infl
 ation in the world. However\, there was a decline in traffic from this cou
 ntry in favor of Kenya during the last recorded time period (Summer 2021).
  Future work will consider how the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the imp
 ending global financial crisis have and will affect the geography of data 
 work in 2022 and early 2023.\n\nNils Rudi\nProfessor\, Yale School of Mana

 on this project look at is how to forecast win probabilities and goal dist
 ribution during a game of soccer. The difference of two Poisson processes 
 calibrated from betting odds provides a simple and quite good model to est
 imate soccer in-play win probabilities. In earlier work\, we studied such 
 models including some analytical properties and extensions to time-depende
 nt and score dependent goal arrival rates. This project aims at extending 
 these models to take into account various elements\, including: –Red car
 ds –Other factors for pre-game prediction –Uncertainty (error) in para
 meter estimates –Updating –Metrics for forecasting accuracy\, mainly b
 ased on scoring rules (Brier score is a simple example). The project will 
 require good mastery or R and preferably Python and will mainly use method
 s from Stochastic Processes\, Markov Chains and Bayesian Methods.\n\nJenni

 \n\nPredicting public climate change beliefs\, attitudes\, policy support\
 , and behavior\n\nTwo project options exist. The first is already underway
  and focuses on assessing the effect of extreme weather on individual and 
 neighborhood-level climate change vulnerability and adaptation efforts. Th
 e second opportunity is starting in January and includes a meta-analysis o
 f hundreds of RCT climate change message experiments across the US and pre
 dictive modeling of national climate change advertising campaign effective
 ness\, including behavioral outcomes.    Description for Project #1:  I
 n the US\, ideology and demographic factors are the primary determinants o
 f individual’s climate-change related attitudes and behaviors\; for exam
 ple Democrats are more worried than Republicans and younger Americans are 
 more worried than older Americans. Other factors\, including personal expe
 rience and local environmental changes have smaller but significant influe
 nces. Importantly\, unlike ideology and demographics\, these latter factor
 s change over time and may provide windows of opportunity to encourage ind
 ividual and collective adaptation and mitigation on climate change. In add
 ition\, such factors play a much larger role in determining attitudes and 
 behaviors outside the U.S. This project aims to identify 1) how much varia
 tion in Americans’ climate attitudes is explained by geography and local
  environmental changes\; 2) which climate hazards are perceived as most se
 rious in different regions\; and 3) how perceptions compare with actual ri
 sks\; and 4) how these gaps affect preparedness and adaptation behaviors f
 or different subpopulations. Analysis will be based on a rich US survey da
 taset (N > 11\,000) of georeferenced respondents coupled with census\, eco
 nomic\, political\, weather\, geographic\, and other data. Machine learnin
 g will be used to develop and validate multilevel regression and poststrat
 ification (MRP) models for different hazards and subpopulations. The model
 s will identify individual and higher spatial level contextual predictors 
 of risk and responses at multiple spatial scales. The MRP models will then
  be applied to create neighborhood-level vulnerability maps based on perce
 ption as well as traditional data (i.e.\, physical and sociodemographic fa
 ctors). This project is focused on the US\, but will have data from India 
 and the UK for similar analyses.     Details for Project #2 are in deve

 the geographical and environmental distribution of all species on the plan
 et at 1km^2\n\nMuch of modern ecology and conservation relies on accurate 
 and reliable predictions of the current spatial distribution of species\, 
 the environmental “niche” of those species\, and how both of these thi
 ngs might change under potential climate change scenarios. On my team\, an
 d alongside our partners\, we are currently well underway with the effort 
 to produce these models (Species Distribution Models\, SDMs) across all te
 rrestrial plant and animal species in North America at 1km^2. Modeling spe
 cies distributions at such a (relatively) fine resolution means the impact
  of ecological processes such as dispersal limitations\, biotic interactio
 ns\, and more begin to play a more significant role than in coarser resolu
 tion models\, meaning we need to develop more sophisticated statistical mo
 dels capable of capturing these processes. At the same time\, the broad sc
 ope of our study has introduced a wide array of computational challenges t
 o making this entire effort tractable. Our team also uses these SDM produc
 ts to quantify species’ vulnerability to climate change and habitat loss
  and to derive optimal conservation strategies jointly across all species 
 and ecosystems. These analyses as well as our primary SDMs are also made a
 vailable to our governmental partners and the public via the Yale Map of L
