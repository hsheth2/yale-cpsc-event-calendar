DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“A Theory of Universal L
 earning”\n\nSpeaker: Steve Hanneke\n\nAssistant Professor\, Purdue Unive
 rsity\n\nTalk summary:\nHow quickly can a given class of concepts be learn
 ed from examples? It is common to measure the performance of a supervised 
 machine learning algorithm by plotting its “learning curve”\, that is\
 , the decay of the error rate as a function of the number of training exam
 ples. However\, the classical theoretical framework for understanding lear
 nability\, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Valiant\, does not exp
 lain the behavior of learning curves: the distribution-free PAC model of l
 earning can only bound the upper envelope of the learning curves over all 
 possible data distributions. This does not match the practice of machine l
 earning\, where the data source is typically fixed in any given scenario\,
  while the learner may choose the number of training examples on the basis
  of factors such as computational resources and desired accuracy.\n\nIn th
 is work\, we study an alternative learning model that better captures such
  practical aspects of machine learning\, but still gives rise to a complet
 e theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely\,
  we consider the problem of universal learning\, which aims to understand 
 the performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution\, but wi
 thout requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this 
 work is a remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of un
 iversal learning. More precisely\, we show that the learning curves of any
  given concept class decay either at an exponential\, linear\, or arbitrar
 ily slow rates. Moreover\, each of these cases is completely characterized
  by appropriate combinatorial parameters\, and we exhibit optimal learning
  algorithms that achieve the best possible rate in each case.\n\nJoint wor

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“On learning in the pres
 ence of biased data and strategic behavior”\n\nSpeaker: Avrim Blum\n\nPr
 ofessor and Chief Academic Officer\nToyota Technological Institute at Chic
 ago\n\nhttp://www.ttic.edu/blum\n\nTalk summary:\nIn this talk I will disc
 uss two lines of work involving learning in the presence of biased data an
 d strategic behavior.  In the first\, we ask whether fairness constraints
  on learning algorithms can actually improve the accuracy of the classifie
 r produced\, when training data is unrepresentative or corrupted due to bi
 as.   Typically\, fairness constraints are analyzed as a tradeoff with cl
 assical objectives such as accuracy.  Our results here show there are nat
 ural scenarios where they can be a win-win\, helping to improve overall ac
 curacy.  In the second line of work we consider strategic classification:
  settings where the entities being measured and classified wish to be clas
 sified as positive (e.g.\, college admissions) and will try to modify thei
 r observable features if possible to make that happen.   We consider this
  in the online setting where a particular challenge is that updates made b
 y the learning algorithm will change how the inputs behave as well.\n\nTo

 d Social-Network Structure in Shaping Epidemics”\n\nSpeaker: Samuel V. S
 carpino\, Ph.D.\n\nManaging Director\, Pandemic Prevention Institute\, Hea
 lth Initiative\, The Rockefeller Foundation\n\nTalk summary:\nThe COVID-19
  pandemic has upended our societies and re-shaped the way we go about our 
 day-to-day lives— from how we work and interact to the way we buy grocer
 ies and attend school. Leveraging global data sets that represent billions
  of people\, Sam Scarpino will present a series of studies exploring how o
 ur behavior\, mobility patterns\, and social networks have altered and bee
 n altered by COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented
  to control its spread. Next\, he will examine how we can better incorpora
 te stochasticity and social network heterogeneity and link directionality 
 into forecasting pandemic risk. With these results\, Dr. Scarpino will dem
 onstrate how the complexity of COVID-19 creates epistemological challenges
  associated with model identifiability. Finally\, he will discuss The Rock
 efeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute. The Institute is bui
 lding an equitable\, representative network of data systems that respects 
 sovereignty\, upholds the highest ethical standards\, and empowers decisio
 n-makers to respond efficiently and effectively to pathogen threats. It wi
 ll ensure that early warnings sound when needed and local actors are empow
 ered to take appropriate steps before it is too late. Embracing a combinat
 ion of technological innovation\, capacity building\, and multi-sector col
 laboration\, the Institute and its partners will transform the world’s a
 bility to capture signals and provide rapid response.\n\nTo participate:\n
