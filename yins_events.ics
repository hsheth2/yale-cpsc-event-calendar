 stakis\n\n“Social Network Interventions”\n\nSpeaker: Nicholas Christak
 is\nSterling Professor of Social and Natural Science at Yale University\n\
 nTalk summary:\nIn this overview talk\, Christakis will review recent work
  using insights about social networks in order to design interventions to 
 improve health\, wealth\, and communication in human groups.  The interve
 ntions are of three types\, manipulating connection\, contagion\, and posi
 tion.\n\nSpeaker bio:\n\nNicholas A. Christakis\, MD\, PhD\, MPH\,\nis a s
 ocial scientist and physician at Yale University who conducts research in 
 the fields of network science\, biosocial science\, and behavior genetics.
  His current work focuses on how human biology and health affect\, and are
  affected by\, social interactions and social networks. He directs the Hum
 an Nature Lab and is the Co-Director of the Yale Institute for Network Sci
 ence. He is the Sterling Professor of Social and Natural Science at Yale U
 niversity\, appointed in the Departments of Sociology\; Medicine\; Ecology
  and Evolutionary Biology\; Biomedical Engineering\; and the School of Man
 agement.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yins-distinguished-lecturer

 \n\n“Gaming the Learning”\n\nSpeaker: Amin Karbasi\nAssociate Professo
 r\, Electrical Engineering and Department of Statistics & Data Science\n\n
 Inference\, Information and Decision Systems Group\n\nAbstract:\nConsider 
 the task of learning an unknown concept from a given concept class\; to wh
 at extent does interacting with a domain expert accelerate the learning pr
 ocess? It is common to measure the effectiveness of learning algorithms by
  plotting the “learning curve”\, that is\, the decay of the error rate
  as a function of the algorithm’s resources (examples\, queries\, etc). 
 Thus\, the overarching question in this presentation is whether interactio
 n accelerates learning. It turns out the answer is hidden in better unders
 tanding the two-player infinite games.  So\, if you like games and statis
 tical learning\, then this talk might be of interest to you.\n\n.\n\n\nhtt

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nCS Colloquium - Jason Weston\, Facebook 
 AI & NYU Visiting Research Professor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A journey 
 from ML and NNs to NLP and Beyond: Just more of the same isn’t enough?
 ”\n\nAbstract: The first half of the talk will look back on the last t
 wo decades of machine learning\, neural network and natural language proce
 ssing research for dialogue\, through my personal lens\, to discuss the ad
 vances that have been made and the circumstances in which they happened 
 – to try to give clues of what we should be working on for the future. T
 he second half will dive deeper into some current first steps in those fut
 ure directions\, in particular trying to fix the problems of neural genera
 tive models to enable deeper reasoning with short and long-term coherence\
 , and to ground such dialogue agents to an environment where they can act 
 and learn. We will argue that just scaling up current techniques\, while a
  worthy investigation\, will not be enough to solve these problems.\n\n\n\
