DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“On learning in the pres
 ence of biased data and strategic behavior”\n\nSpeaker: Avrim Blum\n\nPr
 ofessor and Chief Academic Officer\nToyota Technological Institute at Chic
 ago\n\nhttp://www.ttic.edu/blum\n\nTalk summary:\nIn this talk I will disc
 uss two lines of work involving learning in the presence of biased data an
 d strategic behavior.  In the first\, we ask whether fairness constraints
  on learning algorithms can actually improve the accuracy of the classifie
 r produced\, when training data is unrepresentative or corrupted due to bi
 as.   Typically\, fairness constraints are analyzed as a tradeoff with cl
 assical objectives such as accuracy.  Our results here show there are nat
 ural scenarios where they can be a win-win\, helping to improve overall ac
 curacy.  In the second line of work we consider strategic classification:
  settings where the entities being measured and classified wish to be clas
 sified as positive (e.g.\, college admissions) and will try to modify thei
 r observable features if possible to make that happen.   We consider this
  in the online setting where a particular challenge is that updates made b
 y the learning algorithm will change how the inputs behave as well.\n\nTo

 is BS\, MS\, and PhD from MIT in 1987\, 1989\, and 1991 respectively.  He
  then served on the faculty in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
  Mellon University from 1992 to 2017. In 2017 he joined the Toyota Technol
 ogical Institute at Chicago as Chief Academic Officer.\n\nBlum’s main re
 search interests are in Theoretical Computer Science and Machine Learning\
 , including Machine Learning Theory\, Approximation Algorithms\, Algorithm
 ic Game Theory\, and Database Privacy\, as well as connections among them.
  Some current specific interests include multi-agent and distributed learn
 ing\, fairness\, learning systems that know when they don’t know\, and t
 he design of incentive systems. He has served as Program Chair for the IEE
 E Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)\, the Innovations in
  Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS)\, and the Conference on Le
 arning Theory (COLT).  He has served as Chair of the ACM SIGACT Committee
  for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science and on the SIGACT Exe
 cutive Committee.  Blum is recipient of the AI Journal Classic Paper Awar
 d\, the ICML/COLT 10-Year Best Paper Award\, the Sloan Fellowship\, the NS
 F National Young Investigator Award\, and the Herbert Simon Teaching Award
 \, and he is a Fellow of the ACM.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yi
