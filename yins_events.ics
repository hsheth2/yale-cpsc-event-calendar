DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar:\n“\nInfusing Structure and
  Knowledge into Biomedical AI Algorithms”\n\nSpeaker: Marinka Zitnik\n\
 n\nAssistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics\, Harvard Medical School\
 nZitnik Lab:\nhttps://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu\n\n\nTalk summary:\nGrand 
 challenges in biology and medicine often lack annotated examples and requi
 re generalization to entirely new scenarios not seen during training. Howe
 ver\, standard supervised learning is incredibly limited in scenarios\, su
 ch as designing novel medicines\, modeling emerging pathogens\, and treati
 ng rare diseases. In this talk\, I present our efforts to overcome these o
 bstacles by infusing structure and knowledge into learning algorithms. Fir
 st\, I outline our subgraph neural networks that can disentangle distinct 
 aspects of subgraph topology. I then present a general-purpose approach fo
 r few-shot learning on graphs. At the core is the notion of local subgraph
 s that transfer knowledge from one task to another\, even when only a hand
 ful of labeled examples are available. This principle is theoretically jus
 tified as we show the evidence for predictions can be found in subgraphs s
 urrounding the targets. I conclude with applications in drug development a
 nd precision medicine where the algorithmic predictions were validated in 
 human cells and led to the discovery of a new class of drugs.\n\nTo partic
