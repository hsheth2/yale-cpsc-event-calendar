 is\nSterling Professor of Social and Natural Science at Yale University\n\
 nTalk summary:\nIn this overview talk\, Christakis will review recent work
  using insights about social networks in order to design interventions to 
 improve health\, wealth\, and communication in human groups.  The interve
 ntions are of three types\, manipulating connection\, contagion\, and posi
 tion.\n\nSpeaker bio:\n\nNicholas A. Christakis\, MD\, PhD\, MPH\,\nis a s
 ocial scientist and physician at Yale University who conducts research in 
 the fields of network science\, biosocial science\, and behavior genetics.
  His current work focuses on how human biology and health affect\, and are
  affected by\, social interactions and social networks. He directs the Hum
 an Nature Lab and is the Co-Director of the Yale Institute for Network Sci
 ence. He is the Sterling Professor of Social and Natural Science at Yale U
 niversity\, appointed in the Departments of Sociology\; Medicine\; Ecology
  and Evolutionary Biology\; Biomedical Engineering\; and the School of Man
 agement.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yins-distinguished-lecturer

 \n\n“Gaming the Learning”\n\nSpeaker: Amin Karbasi\nAssociate Professo
 r\, Electrical Engineering and Department of Statistics & Data Science\n\n
 Inference\, Information and Decision Systems Group\n\nAbstract:\nConsider 
 the task of learning an unknown concept from a given concept class\; to wh
 at extent does interacting with a domain expert accelerate the learning pr
 ocess? It is common to measure the effectiveness of learning algorithms by
  plotting the “learning curve”\, that is\, the decay of the error rate
  as a function of the algorithm’s resources (examples\, queries\, etc). 
 Thus\, the overarching question in this presentation is whether interactio
 n accelerates learning. It turns out the answer is hidden in better unders
 tanding the two-player infinite games.  So\, if you like games and statis
 tical learning\, then this talk might be of interest to you.\n\n.\n\n\nhtt

 e Institute for Foundations of Data Science\n\n“Balancing covariates in 
 randomized experiments”\n\nAbstract: In randomized experiments\, we rand
 omly assign the treatment that each experimental subject receives. Randomi
 zation can help us accurately estimate the difference in treatment effects
  with high probability. It also helps ensure that the groups of subjects r
 eceiving each treatment are similar. If we have already measured character
 istics of our subjects that we think could influence their response to tre
 atment\, then we can increase the precision of our estimates of treatment 
 effects by balancing those characteristics between the groups.  We show h
 ow to use the recently developed Gram-Schmidt Walk algorithm of Bansal\, D
 adush\, Garg\, and Lovett to efficiently assign treatments to subjects in 
 a way that balances known characteristics without sacrificing the benefits
  of randomization. These allow us to obtain more accurate estimates of tre
 atment effects to the extent that the measured characteristics are predict
 ive of treatment effects\, while also bounding the worst-case behavior whe
 n they are not.\n\nThis is joint work with Chris Harshaw\, Fredrik Sävje\
 , and Peng Zhang.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/fds-seminar-daniel

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFoundations of Data Science Seminar Series
 \n\nSpeaker: Rex Ying\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science\n\n“Graph
  Representation Learning: A Geometric Perspective”\n\nAbstract:\nThe tal
 k focuses on geometric embedding approaches to representation learning on 
 graph-structured data. We observe that certain inductive biases of graph d
 ata\, such as hierarchies and transitive closures\, can be modeled more ef
 fectively through different embedding geometries. We leverage hyperbolic e
 mbeddings\, cone embeddings and order embeddings for incorporating these i
 nductive biases of input graph data when learning node and graph represent
 ations for large-scale\, heterogeneous graph data and challenging tasks.\n
 \nSpeaker Bio:\nRex Ying is an assistant professor in the Department of Co
 mputer Science at Yale University. His research focus includes algorithms 
 for graph neural networks\, geometric embeddings\, and trustworthy ML on g
 raphs. He is the author of many widely used GNN algorithms such as GraphSA
 GE\, PinSAGE and GNNExplainer. In addition\, Rex worked on a variety of ap
 plications of graph learning in physical simulations\, social networks\, N
 LP\, knowledge graphs and biology. He developed the first billion-scale gr
 aph embedding services at Pinterest\, and the graph-based anomaly detectio
 n algorithm at Amazon. He is the winner of the dissertation award at KDD 2
 022.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/fds-seminar-rex-ying
