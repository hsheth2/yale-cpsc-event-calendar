 l spring.\n\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Convex Analysis at Infinity: An Introductio
 n to Astral Space”\n\nSpeaker: Robert Schapire\nMicrosoft Research\n\nA
 bstract:\nNot all convex functions have finite minimizers\; some can only 
 be minimized by a sequence as it heads to infinity.  In this work\, we ai
 m to develop a theory for understanding such minimizers at infinity.  We 
 study\nastral space\n\, a compact extension of Euclidean space to which su
 ch points at infinity have been added.  Astral space is constructed to be
  as small as possible while still ensuring that all linear functions can b
 e continuously extended to the new space.  Although not a vector space\, 
 nor even a metric space\, astral space is nevertheless so well-structured 
 as to allow useful and meaningful extensions of such concepts as convexity
 \, conjugacy\, and subdifferentials.  We develop these concepts and analy
 ze various properties of convex functions on astral space\, including the 
 detailed structure of their minimizers\, exact characterizations of contin
 uity\, and convergence of descent algorithms.\n\nThis is joint work with M
 iroslav Dudík and Matus Telgarsky.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nRobert Schapire is a 
 Partner Researcher at Microsoft Research in New York City.  He received h
 is PhD from MIT in 1991.  After a short postdoc at Harvard\, he joined th
 e technical staff at AT&T Labs (formerly AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1991.
   In 2002\, he became a Professor of Computer Science at Princeton Unive
 rsity.  He joined Microsoft Research in 2014.  His awards include the 1
 991 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award\, the 2003 Gödel Prize\, and the 2004
  Kanelakkis Theory and Practice Award (both of the last two with Yoav Freu
 nd).  He is a fellow of the AAAI\, and a member of both the National Aca
 demy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences.  His main resea
 rch interest is in theoretical and applied machine learning.\n\nThis is an

 ence\, and of Mathematics\n\nProjects:\n\nDrago Radev\nA. Bartlett Giamatt

 l genomics\n\nGraph-neural networks (or geometric deep learning) are revol
 utionizing machine learning and data science. They combine ideas from grap
 h theory\, geometry\, topology\, and deep learning to learn powerful non-l
 inear models on graphical data. In the Van Dijk Lab we are developing seve
 ral new types of graph neural networks\, based on ideas from dynamical sys
 tems\, computer vision\, and natural language processing\, and apply these
  to diverse biomedical applications. In one application\, we are using gra
 ph neural networks to model spatiotemporal brain activity data\, such as w
 hole-cortex calcium imaging and fMRI recordings. In a second application\,
  we are using graph neural networks to model spatial transcriptomic data 
 – a new technology for the measurement of high-dimensional gene expressi
 on at the single-cell level with spatial resolution. Using our algorithm\,
  we infer cell-cell interactions in measurements from kidney cancer and br
 ain tissue of multiple sclerosis patients. In these projects\, there is th
 e opportunity to focus more on the algorithmic side or on the application\
 , and you will work closely with postdocs and grad students in the lab.\n\

  Analysis\n\nWe are currently approaching the broad topic of genome privac
 y and security from two different angles. First\, we are trying to assess 
 the risks presented by public genome databases and other genomic informati
 on floating around to individuals. We are interested in coming up with way
 s to quantify the information leakage in different scenarios\, such as how
  many SNPs would be needed at minimum to identify a person accurately from
  a DNA sample taken from a coffee cup they recently left behind. Second\, 
 we are evaluating the performance of different techniques to enable privac
 y-preserving genome analysis on cloud computing environments such as AWS\,
  Azure\, and Google Cloud Platform. These techniques include Homomorphic E
 ncryption\, Secure Multiparty Computing\, and Trusted Execution Environmen
 ts such as the Intel SGX. Each of these techniques involve certain advanta
 ges and disadvantages compared to the others when it comes to security and
  protection guarantees and strength\, runtime performance\, ease-of-use\, 
 etc. We are always trying to come up with efficient algorithms and data st
 ructures that allow the use of these techniques to aid with core bioinform
 atics tasks such as genotype imputation and genome-wide association studie
 s.\n\nJulian Posada\nIncoming Assistant Professor\, American Studies\n\nju

 Population: Mapping the Availability of Online Data Work\n\nMany organizat
 ions that develop data-intensive technologies outsource data generation\, 
 annotation\, and verification processes through online platforms like Amaz
 on Mechanical Turk\, Remotasks\, and Appen. Data workers are an invisible 
 population because platform companies often conceal information about thei
 r contractual workers to researchers. Other options to study this invisibl
 e population using computational social research methods exist\, including
  analyzing web traffic data to understand the geography of data work. This
  talk presents an ongoing project to study the coloniality of data work\, 
 a crucial step in understanding the social conditions in which many data s
 ets are developed. The preliminary results show the existence of a North-S
 outh divide in data production\, in which most of the demand for data work
  comes from the United States and the supply from a handful of countries w
 ith particular social\, economic\, and infrastructural conditions. I colle
 cted web traffic data from 93 platforms in 2019-2021 and found that most o
 f the workers’ traffic comes from Venezuela\, a country experiencing the
  highest levels of inflation in the world. However\, there was a decline i
 n traffic from this country in favor of Kenya during the last recorded tim
 e period (Summer 2021). Future work will consider how the Russian invasion
  of Ukraine and the impending global financial crisis have and will affect
  the geography of data work in 2022 and early 2023.\n\nNils Rudi\nProfesso
 r\, Yale School of Management\n\nnils.rudi@yale.edu\n\nSoccer in-play prob
 abilities\n\nThe question this project look at is how to forecast win prob
 abilities and goal distribution during a game of soccer. The difference of
  two Poisson processes calibrated from betting odds provides a simple and 
 quite good model to estimate soccer in-play win probabilities. In earlier 
 work\, we studied such models including some analytical properties and ext
 ensions to time-dependent and score dependent goal arrival rates. This pro
 ject aims at extending these models to take into account various elements\
 , including: –Red cards –Other factors for pre-game prediction –Unce
 rtainty (error) in parameter estimates –Updating –Metrics for forecast
 ing accuracy\, mainly based on scoring rules (Brier score is a simple exam
 ple). The project will require good mastery or R and preferably Python and
  will mainly use methods from Stochastic Processes\, Markov Chains and Bay
 esian Methods.\n\nZhuoran Yang\nAssistant Professor\, Statistics and Data

 nNavigating a maze efficiently with deep reinforcement learning\n\nHow do 
 we use a map to guide us to a desired place? First\, we locate ourselves o
 n the map by looking at the surroundings. Then\, we find a path on the map
  that connects our current spot and the target spot\, and follow the path.
  But what if we don’t have a map at hand? Deep reinforcement learning is
  a class of algorithms that exactly deals with such a challenging scenario
 .\n\nIn specific\, deep reinforcement learning consists of three component
 s — (i) exploration\, (ii) representation learning\, (iii) decision-maki
 ng. Exploration module specifies how the algorithm collects the data — w
 andering around to see the neighborhood. Representation learning module ex
 tracts useful representations from the observations — building a map in 
 our mind based on the gathered data. Decision making module learns the opt
 imal decisions based on the representation model – finding a path on the
  learned map and start the navigation.\n\nIn this project\, we aim to impl
 ement deep reinforcement learning algorithms for solving a stylized naviga
 tion problem on partially observable mazes\, where the observations are th
 e surroundings. We will explore how different the choices of the three com
 ponents affect the performance of the deep reinforcement learning algorith
 m. For example\, in terms of exploration\, we can use epsilon-greedy\, UCB
 \, and Thompson sampling\; in terms of representation learning\, we can us
 e VAE and contrastive learning\; and in terms of decision making\, we can 
 use actor-critic or Q-learning. We aim to gain some understanding of how t
 o design an efficient deep reinforcement learning algorithm in a principle
 d manner.\n\nJennifer Marlon\nSenior Research Scientist\, School of the En
 vironment\nDirector of Data Science\, Yale Program on Climate Change Commu

 Biology\n\njennifer.marlon@yale.edu\n|\nhttps://environment.yale.edu/profi
 le/jennifer-marlon\n\nPredicting public climate change beliefs\, attitudes
 \, policy support\, and behavior\n\nTwo project options exist. The first i
 s already underway and focuses on assessing the effect of extreme weather 
 on individual and neighborhood-level climate change vulnerability and adap
 tation efforts. The second opportunity is starting in January and includes
  a meta-analysis of hundreds of RCT climate change message experiments acr
 oss the US and predictive modeling of national climate change advertising 
 campaign effectiveness\, including behavioral outcomes.    Description f
 or Project #1:  In the US\, ideology and demographic factors are the prim
 ary determinants of individual’s climate-change related attitudes and be
 haviors\; for example Democrats are more worried than Republicans and youn
 ger Americans are more worried than older Americans. Other factors\, inclu
 ding personal experience and local environmental changes have smaller but 
 significant influences. Importantly\, unlike ideology and demographics\, t
 hese latter factors change over time and may provide windows of opportunit
 y to encourage individual and collective adaptation and mitigation on clim
 ate change. In addition\, such factors play a much larger role in determin
 ing attitudes and behaviors outside the U.S. This project aims to identify
  1) how much variation in Americans’ climate attitudes is explained by g
 eography and local environmental changes\; 2) which climate hazards are pe
 rceived as most serious in different regions\; and 3) how perceptions comp
 are with actual risks\; and 4) how these gaps affect preparedness and adap
 tation behaviors for different subpopulations. Analysis will be based on a
  rich US survey dataset (N > 11\,000) of georeferenced respondents coupled
  with census\, economic\, political\, weather\, geographic\, and other dat
 a. Machine learning will be used to develop and validate multilevel regres
 sion and poststratification (MRP) models for different hazards and subpopu
 lations. The models will identify individual and higher spatial level cont
 extual predictors of risk and responses at multiple spatial scales. The MR
 P models will then be applied to create neighborhood-level vulnerability m
 aps based on perception as well as traditional data (i.e.\, physical and s
 ociodemographic factors). This project is focused on the US\, but will hav
 e data from India and the UK for similar analyses.     Details for Proj
 ect #2 are in development!\n\nWalter Jetz\nProfessor of Ecology & Evolutio

 io\n\nModeling the geographical and environmental distribution of all spec
 ies on the planet at 1km^2\n\nMuch of modern ecology and conservation reli
 es on accurate and reliable predictions of the current spatial distributio
 n of species\, the environmental “niche” of those species\, and how bo
 th of these things might change under potential climate change scenarios. 
 On my team\, and alongside our partners\, we are currently well underway w
 ith the effort to produce these models (Species Distribution Models\, SDMs
 ) across all terrestrial plant and animal species in North America at 1km^
 2. Modeling species distributions at such a (relatively) fine resolution m
 eans the impact of ecological processes such as dispersal limitations\, bi
 otic interactions\, and more begin to play a more significant role than in
  coarser resolution models\, meaning we need to develop more sophisticated
  statistical models capable of capturing these processes. At the same time
 \, the broad scope of our study has introduced a wide array of computation
 al challenges to making this entire effort tractable. Our team also uses t
 hese SDM products to quantify species’ vulnerability to climate change a
 nd habitat loss and to derive optimal conservation strategies jointly acro
 ss all species and ecosystems. These analyses as well as our primary SDMs 
 are also made available to our governmental partners and the public via th

 n\n\nInnovative Approaches to Modeling Migration During the Pandemic\n\nIn
  this project\, we will develop innovative approaches to modeling US domes
 tic migration during the pandemic\, using multiple data sources. These dat
 a sources include VIIRS night light data\, cell phone data\, Zillow housin
 g price data\, longitudinal survey data\, USPS change of addresses data\, 
 and potentially a couple of others. Ideal candidates should have the exper
 tise and strong interests in spatial analyses\, data visualization\, and p
 anel analyses using R\, Stata\, ArcGIS\, or Python. I will also introduce 
 many other data our team has for other projects\, which can be explored if
  the candidate has an interesting idea.\n\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar: Yuchen Wu\n\n“Fundamental L
 imits of Low-Rank Matrix Estimation: Information-Theoretic and Computation
 al Perspectives”\n\nSpeaker: Yuchen Wu\nStanford University\n\nWebcast\n
 \nAbstract:\nMany statistical estimation problems can be reduced to the re
 construction of a low-rank n×d matrix when observed through a noisy chann
 el. While tremendous positive results have been established\, relatively f
 ew works focus on understanding the fundamental limitations of the propose
 d models and algorithms. Understanding such limitations not only provides 
 practitioners with guidance on algorithm selection\, but also spurs the de
 velopment of cutting-edge methodologies.   In this talk\, I will present 
 some recent progress in this direction from two perspectives in the contex
 t of low-rank matrix estimation. From an information-theoretic perspective
 \, I will give an exact characterization of the limiting minimum estimatio
 n error. Our results apply to the high-dimensional regime n\,d→∞ and d
 /n→∞ (or d/n→0) and generalize earlier works that focus on the propo
 rtional asymptotics n\,d→∞\, d/n→δ∈(0\,∞). From an algorithmic 
 perspective\, large-dimensional matrices are often processed by iterative 
 algorithms like power iteration and gradient descent\, thus encouraging th
 e pursuit of understanding the fundamental limits of these approaches. We 
 introduce a class of general first order methods (GFOM)\, which is broad e
 nough to include the aforementioned algorithms and many others. I will des
 cribe the asymptotic behavior of any GFOM\, and provide a sharp characteri
 zation of the optimal error achieved by the GFOM class.\n\nThis is based o

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar: Aditi Laddha\n\n“High-Dime
 nsional Markov Chains and Applications”\n\nSpeaker: Aditi Laddha\n\nWeb
 cast.\n\nAbstract:\nA Markov chain is a random process in which the next s
 tate is chosen according to some probability distribution that depends onl
 y on the current state. In a high-dimensional setting\, Markov chains are 
 essential tools for understanding the geometry of the space and form the b
 ackbone of many efficient randomized algorithms for tasks like optimizatio
 n\, integration\, linear programming\, approximate counting\, etc. In this
  talk\, I will provide an overview of my research on “High-Dimensional M
 arkov Chains\,” with a focus on the geometric aspects of the chains.\n\n
 I will describe two results that illustrate the importance of Markov chain
 s for designing efficient algorithms. First\, I will discuss my work on a 
 barrier-based random walk for bounding the discrepancy of set systems. I w
 ill then present a general framework for bounding discrepancy in various s
 ettings. Second\, I will describe two Markov chains\, the Weighted Dikin W
 alk and Coordinate Hit-and-Run for sampling convex bodies\, and discuss ne
 w techniques for bounding their convergence rates.    You are invited to
  a scheduled Zoom meeting. Zoom is Yale’s audio and visual conferencing
