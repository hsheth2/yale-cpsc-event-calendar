 Effects of caste-based affirmative action in governance on socio-economic 
 networks and resource provision”\n\n\nSpeaker: Emily Breza\n\nAssistant 
 Professor of Economics\, Harvard University\n\n\nTalk Summary:\nWe study t
 he impacts of political affirmative action for historically disadvantaged 
 caste groups in Bihar\, India on village social and economic networks. The
 se networks shape the socio-economic landscape\, serving many functions su
 ch as facilitating social learning\, risk-sharing and public good provisio
 n. To estimate the causal impacts of the policy\, we conduct surveys in co
 mmunities around the discontinuity in the state government’s policy assi
 gnment rule.\n\nWe have two main findings. First\, the marginal constituen
 cy assigned to the reservation policy experiences a drop in cross-caste ne
 twork links and an increase in homophily. Consistent with increased homoph
 ily\, reservation leads to less social learning when information is introd
 uced to the community – on average there is worse knowledge about health
  preserving behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Further\, the declin
 e in meetings across caste is met with weakened norms about the appropriat
 eness of cross-caste interactions. Second\, we turn to resource access and
  find that the reservation improves access to redistribution schemes as we
 ll as the agility of governmental response to provide resources in respons
 e to shocks. Both lower and upper castes benefited\, indicating no crowd-o
 ut at the expense of upper castes.\n\nStrikingly\, we find no decline in t
 he salience of caste concerns and no shifts in beliefs about trustworthine
 ss\, competence\, or work ethic\, among others\, across caste. So\, the in
 creased homophily is not met with increased animus\; norm shifts are drive
 n by meeting shifts. Our findings suggest that there is scope for pairing 
 reservation with other interventions to mitigate the impacts of affirmativ
 e action on fractionalization while preserving the resource allocation ben
 efits.\n\n(joint with Arun Chandrasekhar and M. R. Sharan)\n\nTo Participa

 or measuring socio-economic networks.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/even
