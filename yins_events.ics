DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“ReLU nets are powerful memorizers: a ti
 ght analysis of finite sample expressive power”\n\nSpeaker: Suvrit Sra\n
 Associate Professor\, Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Scie
 nce\nInstitute for Data\, Systems & Society (IDSS)\nMassachusetts Institut
 e of Technology\n\nAbstract:\nI will talk about finite sample expressivity
 \, aka memorization power of ReLU networks. Recent results showed (unsurpr
 isingly) that arbitrary input data could be perfectly memorized using a sh
 allow ReLU network with one hidden layer having N hidden nodes. I will des
 cribe a more careful construction that trades of width with depth to show 
 that a ReLU network with 2 hidden layers\, each with 2*sqrt(N) hidden node
 s\, can perfectly memorize arbitrary datasets. Moreover\, we prove that wi
 dth of Θ(sqrt(N)) is necessary and sufficient for having perfect memoriza
 tion power. A notable corollary of this result is that mild overparametriz
 ation suffices to permit a NN to achieve zero training loss!\n\nWe extend 
 our results to deep networks too and combined with recent results on VC-di
 mension of deep nets\, we show that our results on memorization power are 
 nearly tight. Time permitting\, I will mention expressive power results fo
 r Resnets\, as well as how SGD behaves on optimizing such networks.\n\nSpe
 aker Bio:\nSuvrit Sra is an Associate Professor in the EECS Department at 
 MIT\, and also a core faculty member of the Laboratory for Information and
  Decision Systems (LIDS)\, the Institute for Data\, Systems\, and Society 
 (IDSS)\, as well as a member of MIT-ML and Statistics groups. He obtained 
 his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin. Before
  moving to MIT\, he was a Senior Research Scientist at the Max Planck Inst
 itute for Intelligent Systems\, Tübingen\, Germany. He has held visiting 
 faculty positions at UC Berkeley (EECS) and Carnegie Mellon University (Ma
 chine Learning Department) during 2013-2014. His research bridges a number
  of mathematical areas such as differential geometry\, matrix analysis\, c
 onvex analysis\, probability theory\, and optimization with machine learni
 ng. He founded the OPT (Optimization for Machine Learning) series of works
 hops\, held from OPT2008–2017 at the NeurIPS (erstwhile NIPS) conference
 . He has co-edited a book with the same name (MIT Press\, 2011). He is als
 o a co-founder and chief scientist of a healthcare-AI startup.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:YINS Distinguished Lecturer: Mikhail Belkin (OSU)

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“From classical statistics to modern mac
 hine learning”\n\nSpeaker: Mikhail Belkin\nProfessor in the Department o
 f Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Statistics at the
  Ohio State University\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n“A model with zero training err
 or is  overfit to the training data and  will typically generalize poorl
 y” goes statistical textbook wisdom. Yet\, in modern practice over-param
 etrized deep networks with near perfect  fit on training data still show 
 excellent test performance. As I will discuss in the talk\, this apparent 
 contradiction is key to understanding the practice of modern machine learn
 ing. While classical methods rely on a trade-off balancing the complexity 
 of  predictors with  training error\,  modern models are best described
  by interpolation\,  where  a predictor is chosen  among functions that
   fit the training data exactly\, according  to a certain (implicit or e
 xplicit) inductive bias. Furthermore\,  classical and modern models can b
 e unified within a single  ”double descent” risk curve\,  which exte
 nds the classical U-shaped  bias-variance curve  beyond the point of int
 erpolation. This understanding of model performance  delineates the limit
 s of the usual ”what you see is what you get” generalization bounds in
  machine learning and  points to  new analyses required to understand  
 computational\, statistical\, and mathematical properties of modern models
 .\n\n\n\nI will proceed to discuss some important implications of interpol
 ation for  optimization\,  both in terms of “easy” optimization due 
 the scarcity of non-global minima\,  and to fast convergence of small min
 i-batch SGD with fixed step size.\n\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nMikhail Belkin is a
  Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the D
 epartment of Statistics at the Ohio State University.  He received his Ph
 D from  the University of Chicago in Mathematics in 2003.  His research 
 focuses on understanding the fundamental structure in data\, the principle
 s of recovering these structures and their computational\, mathematical an
 d statistical properties.\n\nThis understanding\, in turn\, leads to algor
 ithms for dealing with real-world data. His work includes algorithms such 
 as Laplacian Eigenmaps and Manifold Regularization which use ideas of clas
 sical differential geometry for analyzing non-linear high-dimensional data
  and have been widely used in applications.  Prof. Belkin is a recipient 
 of an NSF Career Award and a number of best paper and other awards. He has
  served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Machine Learning Researc
 h and IEEE PAMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n

SUMMARY:Network Science Special Seminar: Platform Business Models with Chr
 istoph Riedl (Northeastern)
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20191204T170000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20191204T180000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDescription\n\nFive of the 10 most valuabl
 e companies in the world today operate under a platform business model: Ap
 ple\, Alphabet (Google)\, Amazon\, Facebook\, and Microsoft. Multisided pl
 atforms facilitate interactions or transactions between parties. At their 
 core\, they leverage network effects—positive externalities—to generat
 e win-win situations for their suppliers and consumers. In this special to
 pics seminar I will introduce platform business models\, how they are base
 d on network science\, and provide examples. We will discuss how tradition
 al products and services can be turned into platforms.\n\nInstructor Bio\n
 \nChristoph Riedl is associate professor for Information Systems and Netwo
 rk Science at the\nD’Amore-McKim School of Business\nat\nNortheastern Un
 iversity\n. He hold a joint appointment with the\nKhoury College of Comput
 er Sciences\nand is a core faculty member at the\nNetwork Science Institut
 e\n. He is a fellow at the\nInstitute for Quantitative Social Science\n(IQ
 SS) at Harvard. He is recipient of a Young Investigator Award (YIP) from t
 he Army Research Office (ARO) for his work on social networks in collabora
 tive decision-making. Before joining Northeastern University he was a post
 -doctoral fellow at Harvard Business School and IQSS. He received a PhD in
  Information Systems from Technische Universität München (TUM)\, Germany

 ience in 2006. His research interests are to understand how social and eco
