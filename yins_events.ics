DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n\n\nYINS/EE Seminar: Ali Maatouk\, M.Sc.\
 , Ph.D.\n\nTitle:\nOptimizing Cellular Networks at Scale: The Role of Mach
 ine Learning\n\nAbstract:\nAs the reliance on mobile devices for daily act
 ivities such as internet browsing\, social media\, and video streaming con
 tinues to grow\, the demand for data is rapidly increasing. The introducti
 on of 5G technology is expected to further exacerbate this trend\, with em
 erging applications like virtual reality and the Internet of Things becomi
 ng more prevalent. To keep pace with this rising demand\, it is crucial to
  ensure that cellular networks operate at their optimal configuration. To 
 do so\, historically\, network configuration optimization relied on measur
 ement campaigns\, trial and error\, and engineering experience\, which is 
 a labor-intensive and error-prone process. In this talk\, we will discuss 
 how the field of cellular network optimization is undergoing a revolution 
 with the advent of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can now b
 e trained on vast amounts of cellular data\, gaining insights into network
  usage\, traffic patterns\, and user behavior\, which can be utilized to o
 ptimize the network’s configuration and resource allocation. Additionall
 y\, we will examine how machine learning can enable seamless operation and
  management of the network\, dealing with any anomalous behavior that may 
 occur. We will also explore some of the current research challenges and fu
 ture opportunities in this field.\n\nBio:\nAli Maatouk received the M.Sc. 
 and Ph.D. degrees from CentraleSupélec\, Gif-sur-Yvette\, France\, in 201
 7 and 2020\, respectively. From 2018 to 2020\, he spent his time on multi
 ple occasions at the University of Maryland\, College Park\, as a visiting
  Ph.D. student. Since 2021\, he has been a Researcher at Huawei Technologi
 es in Boulogne-Billancourt\, France. His research interests include the ma
 thematical modeling and optimization of wireless systems\, 5G and beyond s
 ystems\, and the notion of semantics communications. He was the recipient 
 of both the regional and national André Blanc-Lapierre awards for best ma
 ster’s student in France in the domain of electricity\, information tech
 nology\, and communication. For his Ph.D.\, he received the Paris-Saclay P
 h.D. award for one of the best scientific contributions.\n\nThis will be a
