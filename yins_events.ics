DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“Contrastive learning\, 
 multi-view redundancy\, and linear models”\n\nSpeaker: Daniel Hsu\n\nCol
 umbia University\n\nAbstract:\nContrastive learning is a “self-supervise
 d” approach to representation learning that uses naturally occurring sim
 ilar and dissimilar pairs of data points to find useful embeddings of data
 . We study contrastive learning in the context of multi-view statistical m
 odels. First\, we show that whenever the views of the data are approximate
 ly redundant in their ability to predict a target function\, a low-dimensi
 onal embedding obtained via contrastive learning affords a linear predicto
 r with near-optimal predictive accuracy. Second\, we show that in the cont
 ext of topic models\, the embedding can be interpreted as a linear transfo
 rmation of the posterior moments of the hidden topic distribution given th
 e observed words. We also empirically demonstrate that linear classifiers 
 with these representations perform well in document classification tasks w
 ith very few labeled examples in a semi-supervised setting.\n\nThis is joi
 nt work with Akshay Krishnamurthy (MSR) and Christopher Tosh (Columbia).\n

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“A Theory of Universal L
 earning”\n\nSpeaker: Steve Hanneke\n\nAssistant Professor\, Purdue Unive
 rsity\n\nTalk summary:\nHow quickly can a given class of concepts be learn
 ed from examples? It is common to measure the performance of a supervised 
 machine learning algorithm by plotting its “learning curve”\, that is\
 , the decay of the error rate as a function of the number of training exam
 ples. However\, the classical theoretical framework for understanding lear
 nability\, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Valiant\, does not exp
 lain the behavior of learning curves: the distribution-free PAC model of l
 earning can only bound the upper envelope of the learning curves over all 
 possible data distributions. This does not match the practice of machine l
 earning\, where the data source is typically fixed in any given scenario\,
  while the learner may choose the number of training examples on the basis
  of factors such as computational resources and desired accuracy.\n\nIn th
 is work\, we study an alternative learning model that better captures such
  practical aspects of machine learning\, but still gives rise to a complet
 e theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely\,
  we consider the problem of universal learning\, which aims to understand 
 the performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution\, but wi
 thout requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this 
 work is a remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of un
 iversal learning. More precisely\, we show that the learning curves of any
  given concept class decay either at an exponential\, linear\, or arbitrar
 ily slow rates. Moreover\, each of these cases is completely characterized
  by appropriate combinatorial parameters\, and we exhibit optimal learning
  algorithms that achieve the best possible rate in each case.\n\nJoint wor

 ence of biased data and strategic behavior”\n\nSpeaker: Avrim Blum\n\nPr
 ofessor and Chief Academic Officer\nToyota Technological Institute at Chic
 ago\n\nhttp://www.ttic.edu/blum\n\nTalk summary:\nIn this talk I will disc
 uss two lines of work involving learning in the presence of biased data an
 d strategic behavior.  In the first\, we ask whether fairness constraints
  on learning algorithms can actually improve the accuracy of the classifie
 r produced\, when training data is unrepresentative or corrupted due to bi
 as.   Typically\, fairness constraints are analyzed as a tradeoff with cl
 assical objectives such as accuracy.  Our results here show there are nat
 ural scenarios where they can be a win-win\, helping to improve overall ac
 curacy.  In the second line of work we consider strategic classification:
  settings where the entities being measured and classified wish to be clas
 sified as positive (e.g.\, college admissions) and will try to modify thei
 r observable features if possible to make that happen.   We consider this
  in the online setting where a particular challenge is that updates made b
 y the learning algorithm will change how the inputs behave as well.\n\nTo

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS/EE Seminar\n\n“Advanced and Coordin
 ated Inverter Control for a Secure Electrical Grid with High Penetrations 
 of Renewables”\n\nSpeaker:\nPanayiotis (Panos) Moutis\, PhD\n\nSpecial F
 aculty with the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon U
 niversity (CMU)\n\nAbstract:\nThe main reason an electrical grid collapses
  is the disruption of the generation-demand balance\; i.e.\, not enough ge
 neration for all loads or no electrical paths (energy flow through wires) 
 for that reason. Until recently\, conventional energy sources that were sp
 inning physical generator rotors\, represented considerable inertia\, whic
 h would limit the effects of generation-demand imbalances and keep them ma
 nageable by the system. As renewables have been steadily increasing and\, 
 thus\, displacing conventional units\, they have also been displacing the 
 inertia of the latter\, which the former cannot replace. This is because r
 enewables are electromechanically decoupled from the grid through inverter
 s or because they do not possess physical inertia in the first place. More
 over\, the inverters themselves incorporate controls of varying time frame
 s that may resonate with internal and grid impedances\, thus\, requiring a
 ppropriate tuning to damp oscillatory behaviors (at the very least). In th
 e first part of this seminar\, we discuss control methods that enable wind
  generators and photovoltaics to take up on the role of conventional resou
 rces in preserving the generation-demand balance. Results of real-world te
 sting prove that the technology is mature and applicability is readily fea
 sible. In the second part\, we review the major concerns on the stability 
 of an electrical grid with high penetrations of inverter-interfaced resour
 ces and how these concerns define a path of research for coordinated activ
 e control. As it will be demonstrated\, the new control paradigm will requ
 ire grid monitoring of high accuracy and time granularity of sub-second sc
 ale. We will conclude with a discussion on the challenges in the path forw
 ard for an inverter-dominated electrical grid.\n\nTo participate:\n\nJoin
