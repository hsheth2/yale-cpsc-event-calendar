DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFDS Seminar\n\n“Convex Analysis at Infin
 ity: An Introduction to Astral Space”\n\nSpeaker: Robert Schapire\nMicr
 osoft Research\n\nAbstract:\nNot all convex functions have finite minimize
 rs\; some can only be minimized by a sequence as it heads to infinity.  I
 n this work\, we aim to develop a theory for understanding such minimizers
  at infinity.  We study\nastral space\n\, a compact extension of Euclidea
 n space to which such points at infinity have been added.  Astral space i
 s constructed to be as small as possible while still ensuring that all lin
 ear functions can be continuously extended to the new space.  Although no
 t a vector space\, nor even a metric space\, astral space is nevertheless 
 so well-structured as to allow useful and meaningful extensions of such co
 ncepts as convexity\, conjugacy\, and subdifferentials.  We develop these
  concepts and analyze various properties of convex functions on astral spa
 ce\, including the detailed structure of their minimizers\, exact characte
 rizations of continuity\, and convergence of descent algorithms.\n\nThis i
 s joint work with Miroslav Dudík and Matus Telgarsky.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nRo

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nData Science Project Match\n\nIn-person ev

 terling Professor of Computer Science\; Professor of Statistics & Data Sci
 ence\, and of Mathematics\n\nProjects:\n\nDrago Radev\nA. Bartlett Giamatt

 \n\nNavigating a maze efficiently with deep reinforcement learning\n\nHow 
 do we use a map to guide us to a desired place? First\, we locate ourselve
 s on the map by looking at the surroundings. Then\, we find a path on the 
 map that connects our current spot and the target spot\, and follow the pa
 th. But what if we don’t have a map at hand? Deep reinforcement learning
  is a class of algorithms that exactly deals with such a challenging scena
 rio.\n\nIn specific\, deep reinforcement learning consists of three compon
 ents — (i) exploration\, (ii) representation learning\, (iii) decision-m
 aking. Exploration module specifies how the algorithm collects the data 
 — wandering around to see the neighborhood. Representation learning modu
 le extracts useful representations from the observations — building a ma
 p in our mind based on the gathered data. Decision making module learns th
 e optimal decisions based on the representation model – finding a path o
 n the learned map and start the navigation.\n\nIn this project\, we aim to
  implement deep reinforcement learning algorithms for solving a stylized n
 avigation problem on partially observable mazes\, where the observations a
 re the surroundings. We will explore how different the choices of the thre
 e components affect the performance of the deep reinforcement learning alg
 orithm. For example\, in terms of exploration\, we can use epsilon-greedy\
 , UCB\, and Thompson sampling\; in terms of representation learning\, we c
 an use VAE and contrastive learning\; and in terms of decision making\, we
  can use actor-critic or Q-learning. We aim to gain some understanding of 
 how to design an efficient deep reinforcement learning algorithm in a prin
 cipled manner.\n\nDavid van Dijk\, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor of Medicine\

 l networks for brain dynamics and spatial genomics\n\nGraph-neural network
 s (or geometric deep learning) are revolutionizing machine learning and da
 ta science. They combine ideas from graph theory\, geometry\, topology\, a
 nd deep learning to learn powerful non-linear models on graphical data. In
  the Van Dijk Lab we are developing several new types of graph neural netw
 orks\, based on ideas from dynamical systems\, computer vision\, and natur
 al language processing\, and apply these to diverse biomedical application
 s. In one application\, we are using graph neural networks to model spatio
 temporal brain activity data\, such as whole-cortex calcium imaging and fM
 RI recordings. In a second application\, we are using graph neural network
 s to model spatial transcriptomic data – a new technology for the measur
 ement of high-dimensional gene expression at the single-cell level with sp
 atial resolution. Using our algorithm\, we infer cell-cell interactions in
  measurements from kidney cancer and brain tissue of multiple sclerosis pa
 tients. In these projects\, there is the opportunity to focus more on the 
 algorithmic side or on the application\, and you will work closely with po
 stdocs and grad students in the lab.\n\nMark Gerstein\nAlbert L Williams P

 n\nPrivacy-Preserving and Secure Genome Analysis\n\nWe are currently appro
 aching the broad topic of genome privacy and security from two different a
 ngles. First\, we are trying to assess the risks presented by public genom
 e databases and other genomic information floating around to individuals. 
 We are interested in coming up with ways to quantify the information leaka
 ge in different scenarios\, such as how many SNPs would be needed at minim
 um to identify a person accurately from a DNA sample taken from a coffee c
 up they recently left behind. Second\, we are evaluating the performance o
 f different techniques to enable privacy-preserving genome analysis on clo
 ud computing environments such as AWS\, Azure\, and Google Cloud Platform.
  These techniques include Homomorphic Encryption\, Secure Multiparty Compu
 ting\, and Trusted Execution Environments such as the Intel SGX. Each of t
 hese techniques involve certain advantages and disadvantages compared to t
 he others when it comes to security and protection guarantees and strength
 \, runtime performance\, ease-of-use\, etc. We are always trying to come u
 p with efficient algorithms and data structures that allow the use of thes
 e techniques to aid with core bioinformatics tasks such as genotype imputa
 tion and genome-wide association studies.\n\nJulian Posada\nIncoming Assis

 y of Online Data Work\n\nMany organizations that develop data-intensive te
 chnologies outsource data generation\, annotation\, and verification proce
 sses through online platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk\, Remotasks\, an
 d Appen. Data workers are an invisible population because platform compani
 es often conceal information about their contractual workers to researcher
 s. Other options to study this invisible population using computational so
 cial research methods exist\, including analyzing web traffic data to unde
 rstand the geography of data work. This talk presents an ongoing project t
 o study the coloniality of data work\, a crucial step in understanding the
  social conditions in which many data sets are developed. The preliminary 
 results show the existence of a North-South divide in data production\, in
  which most of the demand for data work comes from the United States and t
 he supply from a handful of countries with particular social\, economic\, 
 and infrastructural conditions. I collected web traffic data from 93 platf
 orms in 2019-2021 and found that most of the workers’ traffic comes from
  Venezuela\, a country experiencing the highest levels of inflation in the
  world. However\, there was a decline in traffic from this country in favo
 r of Kenya during the last recorded time period (Summer 2021). Future work
  will consider how the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impending globa
 l financial crisis have and will affect the geography of data work in 2022
  and early 2023.\n\nNils Rudi\nProfessor\, Yale School of Management\n\nni
 ls.rudi@yale.edu\n\nSoccer in-play probabilities\n\nThe question this proj
 ect look at is how to forecast win probabilities and goal distribution dur
 ing a game of soccer. The difference of two Poisson processes calibrated f
 rom betting odds provides a simple and quite good model to estimate soccer
  in-play win probabilities. In earlier work\, we studied such models inclu
 ding some analytical properties and extensions to time-dependent and score
  dependent goal arrival rates. This project aims at extending these models
  to take into account various elements\, including: –Red cards –Other 
 factors for pre-game prediction –Uncertainty (error) in parameter estima
 tes –Updating –Metrics for forecasting accuracy\, mainly based on scor
 ing rules (Brier score is a simple example). The project will require good
  mastery or R and preferably Python and will mainly use methods from Stoch
 astic Processes\, Markov Chains and Bayesian Methods.\n\nJennifer Marlon\n

 e.edu\n|\nhttps://environment.yale.edu/profile/jennifer-marlon\n\nPredicti
 ng public climate change beliefs\, attitudes\, policy support\, and behavi
 or\n\nTwo project options exist. The first is already underway and focuses
  on assessing the effect of extreme weather on individual and neighborhood
 -level climate change vulnerability and adaptation efforts. The second opp
 ortunity is starting in January and includes a meta-analysis of hundreds o
 f RCT climate change message experiments across the US and predictive mode
 ling of national climate change advertising campaign effectiveness\, inclu
 ding behavioral outcomes.    Description for Project #1:  In the US\, i
 deology and demographic factors are the primary determinants of individual
 ’s climate-change related attitudes and behaviors\; for example Democrat
 s are more worried than Republicans and younger Americans are more worried
  than older Americans. Other factors\, including personal experience and l
 ocal environmental changes have smaller but significant influences. Import
 antly\, unlike ideology and demographics\, these latter factors change ove
 r time and may provide windows of opportunity to encourage individual and 
 collective adaptation and mitigation on climate change. In addition\, such
  factors play a much larger role in determining attitudes and behaviors ou
 tside the U.S. This project aims to identify 1) how much variation in Amer
 icans’ climate attitudes is explained by geography and local environment
 al changes\; 2) which climate hazards are perceived as most serious in dif
 ferent regions\; and 3) how perceptions compare with actual risks\; and 4)
  how these gaps affect preparedness and adaptation behaviors for different
  subpopulations. Analysis will be based on a rich US survey dataset (N > 1
 1\,000) of georeferenced respondents coupled with census\, economic\, poli
 tical\, weather\, geographic\, and other data. Machine learning will be us
 ed to develop and validate multilevel regression and poststratification (M
 RP) models for different hazards and subpopulations. The models will ident
 ify individual and higher spatial level contextual predictors of risk and 
 responses at multiple spatial scales. The MRP models will then be applied 
 to create neighborhood-level vulnerability maps based on perception as wel
 l as traditional data (i.e.\, physical and sociodemographic factors). This
  project is focused on the US\, but will have data from India and the UK f
 or similar analyses.     Details for Project #2 are in development!\n\n

 ical and environmental distribution of all species on the planet at 1km^2\
 n\nMuch of modern ecology and conservation relies on accurate and reliable
  predictions of the current spatial distribution of species\, the environm
 ental “niche” of those species\, and how both of these things might ch
 ange under potential climate change scenarios. On my team\, and alongside 
 our partners\, we are currently well underway with the effort to produce t
 hese models (Species Distribution Models\, SDMs) across all terrestrial pl
 ant and animal species in North America at 1km^2. Modeling species distrib
 utions at such a (relatively) fine resolution means the impact of ecologic
 al processes such as dispersal limitations\, biotic interactions\, and mor
 e begin to play a more significant role than in coarser resolution models\
 , meaning we need to develop more sophisticated statistical models capable
  of capturing these processes. At the same time\, the broad scope of our s
 tudy has introduced a wide array of computational challenges to making thi
 s entire effort tractable. Our team also uses these SDM products to quanti
 fy species’ vulnerability to climate change and habitat loss and to deri
 ve optimal conservation strategies jointly across all species and ecosyste
 ms. These analyses as well as our primary SDMs are also made available to 
 our governmental partners and the public via the Yale Map of Life at\nhttp

 o Modeling Migration During the Pandemic\n\nIn this project\, we will deve
 lop innovative approaches to modeling US domestic migration during the pan
 demic\, using multiple data sources. These data sources include VIIRS nigh
 t light data\, cell phone data\, Zillow housing price data\, longitudinal 
 survey data\, USPS change of addresses data\, and potentially a couple of 
 others. Ideal candidates should have the expertise and strong interests in
  spatial analyses\, data visualization\, and panel analyses using R\, Stat
 a\, ArcGIS\, or Python. I will also introduce many other data our team has
  for other projects\, which can be explored if the candidate has an intere
 sting idea.\n\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/data-science-project-m
