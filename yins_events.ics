 l Technical University of Athens\n\nAbstract:\nIn this talk\, we will disc
 uss the computational challenges arising in various problems in Reliable M
 achine Learning. Reliable ML aims at the design of computationally efficie
 nt algorithms that provide guarantees such as robustness to biased data\, 
 reproducibility and privacy.  We firstly focus on the design of algorithm
 s robust to biased and corrupted observations. We begin with the problem o
 f learning from coarse data. The motivation behind this problem is that in
  many learning tasks one may not have access to fine grained label informa
 tion\; e.g.\, an image can be labeled as husky\, dog\, or even animal depe
 nding on the expertise of the annotator. We formalize these settings from 
 the viewpoint of computational learning theory and provide efficient algor
 ithms and computational hardness results. We then continue with the task o
 f learning noisy linear label rankings. Label ranking is the supervised ta
 sk of learning a sorting function that maps feature vectors to rankings ov
 er a finite set of labels. We provide the first efficient algorithms for l
 earning linear sorting functions in the presence of bounded noise (an exte
 nsion of the Massart noise condition to label rankings) under Gaussian mar
 ginals. Next\, we consider questions regarding responsibility aspects of M
 L systems. We study the important problem of reproducibility as an algorit
 hmic property in decision-making settings. We introduce the notion of repr
 oducible policies in the context of stochastic bandits\, one of the canoni
 cal problems in interactive learning. A policy in the bandit environment i
 s called reproducible if it pulls\, with high probability\, the exact same
  sequence of arms in two different and independent executions (under indep
 endent reward realizations and shared internal randomness). We show that n
 ot only do reproducible policies exist\, but also they achieve almost the 
 same optimal (non-reproducible) regret bounds in terms of the time horizon
 . In the end of the talk\, we will shortly discuss some on-going work on t
 he complexity of min-max optimization\, a fundamental problem in the area 
 of equilibrium computation in multi-agent environments.\n\nAdd event to ca
