DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Industry Seminar\n\n“Dynamics and s
 caling laws in deep learning”\n\nSpeaker: Yasaman Bahri\n\nResearch Scie
 ntist at Google Research\, Brain Team\n\nTalk summary:\nThis talk will dis
 cuss some topics in supervised deep learning from a scientist’s lens\, d
 escribing efforts that seek to bridge theory and experiment. First\, I’l
 l briefly review some of what is known about the learning dynamics of deep
  neural networks\, including highlights from the large-width limit of neur
 al networks. I’ll then focus on efforts to understand empirical “scali
 ng laws” for the performance of neural networks. Recent empirical work h
 as found that the test loss often follows smooth power laws as a function 
 of basic variables such as model size and dataset size. I will discuss our
  work seeking to connect and understand some of these scaling laws. We int
 roduce “variance-limited” and “resolution-limited” scaling regimes
  to distinguish the origin of the power-law behavior. As an illustration\,
  we investigate the case of teacher-student random feature models where we
  can study the problem exactly. I’ll close with a few empirical observat
 ions about task properties and scaling exponents.\n\nTo participate:\nJoin

 m.us/u/aeF0HRmJcA\n\n\nSpeaker bio:\nYasaman Bahri is a Research Scientist
  at Google Research on the Brain team. In the past several years\, she has
  been working at the boundary of machine learning and the physical science
 s\, with a particular focus on bridging theoretical and empirical understa
 nding in deep learning. Her doctoral work is in the area of theoretical co
 ndensed matter physics\, specifically on quantum many-body systems. She re
 ceived her Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley (2017) as well as earlier B.A
 . degrees from UC Berkeley in Physics and Math. She is a recipient of the 
 2020 Rising Stars Award in EECS and the NSF Graduate Fellowship and has co
 -organized two ICML workshops.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/yins-
