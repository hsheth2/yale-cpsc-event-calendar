 randomized experiments”\n\nAbstract:\nIn randomized experiments\, we ran
 domly assign the treatment that each experimental subject receives. Random
 ization can help us accurately estimate the difference in treatment effect
 s with high probability. It also helps ensure that the groups of subjects 
 receiving each treatment are similar. If we have already measured characte
 ristics of our subjects that we think could influence their response to tr
 eatment\, then we can increase the precision of our estimates of treatment
  effects by balancing those characteristics between the groups.  We show 
 how to use the recently developed Gram-Schmidt Walk algorithm of Bansal\, 
 Dadush\, Garg\, and Lovett to efficiently assign treatments to subjects in
  a way that balances known characteristics without sacrificing the benefit
 s of randomization. These allow us to obtain more accurate estimates of tr
 eatment effects to the extent that the measured characteristics are predic
 tive of treatment effects\, while also bounding the worst-case behavior wh
 en they are not.\n\nThis is joint work with Chris Harshaw\, Fredrik Sävje
 \, and Peng Zhang.\n\nThis is an in-person presentation\, but it is access

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFoundations of Data Science Seminar Series
 \n\nSpeaker: Rex Ying\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science\n\n“Graph
  Representation Learning: A Geometric Perspective”\n\nAbstract:\nThe tal
 k focuses on geometric embedding approaches to representation learning on 
 graph-structured data. We observe that certain inductive biases of graph d
 ata\, such as hierarchies and transitive closures\, can be modeled more ef
 fectively through different embedding geometries. We leverage hyperbolic e
 mbeddings\, cone embeddings and order embeddings for incorporating these i
 nductive biases of input graph data when learning node and graph represent
 ations for large-scale\, heterogeneous graph data and challenging tasks.\n
 \nSpeaker Bio:\nRex Ying is an assistant professor in the Department of Co
 mputer Science at Yale University. His research focus includes algorithms 
 for graph neural networks\, geometric embeddings\, and trustworthy ML on g
 raphs. He is the author of many widely used GNN algorithms such as GraphSA
 GE\, PinSAGE and GNNExplainer. In addition\, Rex worked on a variety of ap
 plications of graph learning in physical simulations\, social networks\, N
 LP\, knowledge graphs and biology. He developed the first billion-scale gr
 aph embedding services at Pinterest\, and the graph-based anomaly detectio
 n algorithm at Amazon. He is the winner of the dissertation award at KDD 2
 022.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.edu/event/fds-seminar-rex-ying
