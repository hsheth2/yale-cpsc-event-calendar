  Computation for Spiking Neural Networks through Forward Propagation”\n\
 nAbstract:\nDue to potential reset operations in spiking neural networks (
 SNN)\, most prior literature believes gradients cannot be computed for tra
 ining such networks. Prior works have developed methods like surrogate gra
 dients\, ANN-SNN conversion\, heuristic rules\, etc. to train SNN. By inve
 stigating the dynamics of SNN in continuous time\, invoking the implicit f
 unction theorem\, and exploiting the causal structure of such a network\, 
 we are able to show that we can compute exact gradients and suggest a nove
 l algorithm called forward propagation for computing them.\n\nBio:\nJane L

 \n“Scalable Sampling for Nonsymmetric Determinantal Point Processes”\n
 \nAbstract:\nA determinantal point process (DPP) is a probabilistic model 
 that assigns a probability to every subset of those items. It is conventio
 nally parameterized by a symmetric matrix but recent work shows that remov
 ing the symmetry constraint can lead to significant predictive performance
  gains for machine learning applications. We first propose a linear-time s
 ampling algorithm for kernels with low-rank structures.  Furthermore\, we
  develop a scalable sublinear-time rejection sampling algorithm by constru
 cting a novel proposal distribution.  Additionally\, we show that imposin
 g certain structural constraints on the NDPP kernel enables us to bound th
 e rejection rate in a way that depends only on the kernel rank.\n\nBio:\nI

 n“Essays in Social Coordination”\n\nIn-person attendance is welcome\, 
 but attendees are requested to wear masks.\n\nVia Zoom:\nhttps://yale.zoom
 .us/j/94759113033\n\nAbstract: Social Coordination is an essential feature
  of any social system. Coordination is a precondition for certain kinds of
  cooperation\, as cooperation implies agents working together for a common
  cause\, while coordination only implies agents synchronizing their behavi
 or. For example\, social contagion suggests a mechanism for groups to soci
 ally coordinate without necessarily cooperating. When behaviors spread acr
 oss social ties the people may not be actively intending to spread the beh
 avior\, so they are not always cooperating The necessity of coordination d
 oes not imply that it is easy to achieve. In Chapter 1\, I survey two theo
 retical frameworks for operationalizing the challenges to coordination: Th
 e Prisoner’s Dilemma Game and The Generals Problem. In the Prisoner’s 
 Dilemma game\, the agents will both be better off if they cooperate but ha
 ve strong incentives to betray each other. In this classic case coordinati
 on is expected but it is not Pareto-optimal\, highlighting the differences
  between agents simply coordinating (both playing the same strategy) and c
 ooperation for each other’s benefit. Here\, the impediment to cooperatio
 n is that of misaligned incentives. The General’s Problem presents a dif
 ferent barrier to coordination: unreliable communication channels. The Gen
 erals all have aligned incentives to coordinate and work together\, but du
 e to the chance that messages may fail to be transmitted\, they are unable
  to effectively do so. The Byzantine Generals Problem in effect combines t
 he challenges of coordinating with both misaligned incentives and faulty c
 ommunication. In this setting\, some of the agents are trying to prevent t
 he rest of the group from reach consensus.\n\nChapter 2 is a global consen
 sus experiment in a “Byzantine” setting. The players have 10 rounds of
  communication to reach consensus among a set of arbitrary identifiers. Th
 e players are able to send full text messages to each other. This setting 
 is Byzantine because some of the players disconnect from the game either t
 hrough technical problems on their end or through failing to send their me
 ssages in enough time. Additionally\, we found that a subset of the player
 s did not perfectly understand the instructions of the game and made error
 s\, thus demonstrating that players can engage in Byzantine behavior. The 
 players were arranged into a Watts-Strogatz network and one of the interve
 ntions was altering the fraction of odd vertices in these graphs. The othe
 r intervention was to alter the instructions so as to change the story the
  players were told about why they were trying to reach consensus. We found
  that groups were more likely to reach consensus in groups with a lower fr
 action of odd vertices\, but did not find the changing story about why pla
 yers were coordinating had much impact. We found that the human consensus 
 does exhibit some byzantine fault tolerance. For example the effect of pla
 yers dropping out of the game\, a classic type of byzantine fault\, had a 
 negligible effect on the outcome. However\, we also found that the fractio
 n of players with misunderstandings or errors negatively impacted the cons
 ensus process. The players did demonstrate the ability to correct misunder
 standings in others\, but sometimes misunderstandings were contagious. Not
 ably the effect of misunderstandings is comparable to effect of the fracti
 on of players trying to vote for the first identifier in alphabetical orde
 r. This suggests that in this setting using a bad protocol is comparable i
 n effect to a byzantine fault.\n\nChapter 3 is a methodological exploratio
 n of creating preference-indifferent identifiers. Throughout the testing o
 f identifiers to use in the consensus experiment in Chapter 1\, we found t
 hat the players expressed preferences over random strings of letters and n
 umbers. To remedy this\, we generated nonsense words with an alternating v
 owel and consonant pattern to make them easily pronounceable to English sp
 eakers. We developed a software platform for users to evaluate these nonce
  words as forced-choice paired comparisons. We then used the Elo algorithm
  to generate scores for each of these words. We also developed techniques 
 to find unobserved heterogeneity in ratings for this setting. We found tha
 t human raters do indeed have significant preferences even over these nons
 ense words\, implying that even if the identifiers are randomly generated\
 , they are not necessarily preference-equivalent. We also compared the pre
 ferences we observed with the predictions of Phonological Cure Theory and 
 found that our results were not entirely consistent. While this was not in
 itially devised as a Phonology experiment\, the platform we develop may ha
 ve benefits for conducting Phonology experiments.\n\nChapter 4 is an agent
 -based model assessing the impact of capacity constraints in a threshold c
 ontagion model. Many sorts of contagious phenomenon\, such as music\, do n
 ot exist in isolation but as part of a competitive marketplace. In these s
 ettings there are often superstars with out-sized popularity along with a 
 large number of flops with little popularity. I suggest that capacity cons
 traints may be a structural factor that influences these disparities. In t
 his model\, there are multiple potentially cascading states that the agent
  can potentially occupy. The agents have a certain capacity of states that
  they can occupy at once. For example\, suppose someone has a workout play
 list that lasts 1 hour. As they discover new music to add to the playlist\
 , they have to remove songs currently in the playlist to keep the playlist
  1 hour. Thus\, in this setting\, the states indirectly trade off with eac
 h other by virtue of the capacity constraint. Increasing the number of sta
 tes in excess of capacity increased the unpredictability of which states b
 ecome popular as well as increased the disparities between popular and unp
 opular states. This suggests that capacity constraints may play a role in 
 explaining market concentration and superstar phenomenon.\n\nBio:\nJacob D
