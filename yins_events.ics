DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Information Theory for Trustworthy Mach
 ine Learning”\n\nSpeaker: Hao Wang\nPh.D. candidate\, Harvard Universit
 y\n\nAbstract:\nWe provide an information-theoretic foundation for trustwo
 rthy machine learning (ML). ML algorithms are increasingly used in applica
 tions of significant social consequences. It is crucial to ensure that the
 se algorithms are not just accurate but also generalizable\, fair\, and pr
 ivacy-preserving. By leveraging information-theoretic tools\, we develop r
 igorous performance guarantees for practical ML models and establish proto
 cols to ensure the responsible use of data.   In the first half of the ta
 lk\, we introduce new generalization bounds for understanding the behavior
 s of complex ML models (e.g.\, neural networks). In particular\, we study 
 how the interaction between data distributions and optimization methods in
 fluences generalization. In the second half of the talk\, we characterize 
 a fundamental limit of algorithmic fairness. We provide conditions that en
 sure fair use of group attributes and these theoretical results\, in turn\
 , inspire new algorithms that can repair unfair models without retraining 
 a new one.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nHao Wang is currently a last-year Ph.D. candid
 ate at Harvard University. He received his M.S. degree in applied mathemat
 ics from Harvard University in 2019. In 2016\, he received his B.S. degree
  in mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China (US
 TC). He was awarded the 35th Guo Moruo Scholarship which is the highest ho
 nor at USTC. His research interests include information theory\, statistic
 al learning theory\, and trustworthy machine learning.\n\nThis talk will b
