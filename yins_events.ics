DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Language\, Brain\, and Computation”\n
 \nSpeaker: Christos H. Papadimitriou\nProfessor of Computer Science\, Col
 umbia University\n\nAbstract:\nComputation in the brain has been modeled p
 roductively at many scales\, ranging from molecules to dendrites\, neurons
  and synapses\, all the way to the whole brain models useful in cognitive 
 science.  I will discuss recent work on anl intermediate computational la
 yer\, involving assemblies of neurons — that is to say\, populations of 
 neurons firing together in a repetitive pattern whenever we think of a par
 ticular memory\, concept or idea.  Assemblies were conjectured seven deca
 des ago by Hebb\, and have been over the past two decades noticed in both 
 the animal and the human brain.  Further\, experiments\, simulations\, an
 d theoretical analysis suggest that assemblies can be copied from one brai
 n area to another\, can be associated with other assemblies\, and more.  
 We propose a broader “calculus” of assemblies\, including the operatio
 n “merge”\, comprising a powerful computational model.  One interesti
 ng hypothesis is that assembly operations may underlie some of the most ad
 vanced functions of the human brain\, especially language.  Joint work wi
 th Santosh Vempala\, Wolfgang Maass\, and Michael Collins.\n\n\n\nSpeaker 
 Bio:\nChristos H. Papadimitriou is the Donovan Family professor of compute
 r science at Columbia University.  Before joining Columbia in 2017\, he t
 aught at UC Berkeley for 22 years\, and before that at Harvard\, MIT\, NTU
  Athens\, Stanford\, and UCSD.  He has written five textbooks and many ar
 ticles on algorithms and complexity\, and their applications to optimizati
 on\, databases\, control\, AI\, robotics\, economics and game theory\, the
  Internet\, evolution\, and more recently the study of the brain.  He hol
 ds a PhD from Princeton as well as eight honorary doctorates\, and he has 
 won the Knuth prize\, the Goedel prize\, the von Neumann medal\, and most 
 recently Technion’s Harvey prize.  He is a member of the National Acade
 my of Sciences of the US\, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\, and
  the National Academy of Engineering\, while in 2013 the president of Gree
 ce named him commander of the order of the phoenix.  He has also written 
 three novels: “Turing”\, “Logicomix” and his latest “Independenc
 e”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://yins.yale.
