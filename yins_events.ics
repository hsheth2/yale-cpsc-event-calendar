DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Alumnae Seminar\n\n“Machine Unlearn
 ing via Algorithmic Stability”\n\nSpeaker: Anup Rao\n\nResearch Scientis
 t\, Adobe Research\nFormerly\, beloved YINS graduate student advised by Da
 niel Spielman\n\nTalk summary:\nWe study the problem of machine unlearning
 \, updating a trained machine learning model when part of the data is dele
 ted. We identify a notion of algorithmic stability\, Total Variation (TV) 
 stability\,  and show why it is suitable for the goal of exact unlearning
 . For convex risk minimization problems\, we design TV-stable algorithms b
 ased on noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our key contribution is t
 he design of corresponding efficient unlearning algorithms\, and are based
  on constructing a (maximal) coupling of Markov chains for the noisy SGD p
 rocedure. To understand the trade-offs between accuracy and unlearning eff
 iciency\, we give upper and lower bounds on excess empirical and populatio
 n risk of TV stable algorithms for convex risk minimization.   This is ba
 sed on joint work with Enayat Ullah\, Tung Mai\, Ryan Rossi and Raman Aror
 a\, and  will be presented at COLT 2021.\n\nTo participate:\n\nJoin from
