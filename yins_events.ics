DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar:\n“Wasserstein Distribution
 ally Robust Optimization: Theory and Applications in Machine Learning”\n
 \nSpeaker: Daniel Kuhn (EPFL)\n\nChair of Risk Analytics and Optimization 
 at EPFL\n\nAbstract:\nMany decision problems in science\, engineering and 
 economics are affected by uncertain parameters whose distribution is only 
 indirectly observable through samples. The goal of data-driven decision-ma
 king is to learn a decision from finitely many training samples that will 
 perform well on unseen test samples. This learning task is difficult even 
 if all training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution - es
 pecially if the dimension of the uncertainty is large relative to the trai
 ning sample size. Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization seeks d
 ata-driven decisions that perform well under the most adverse distribution
  within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution constru
 cted from the training samples. In this talk we will see that this approac
 h has many conceptual and computational benefits. Most prominently\, the o
 ptimal decisions can often be computed by solving tractable convex optimiz
 ation problems\, and they enjoy rigorous out-of-sample and asymptotic cons
 istency guarantees. We will also show that Wasserstein distributionally ro
 bust optimization has interesting ramifications for statistical learning a
 nd motivates new approaches for fundamental learning tasks such as classif
 ication\, regression\, maximum likelihood estimation or minimum mean squar
 e error estimation\, among others.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nDaniel Kuhn holds the 
 Chair of Risk Analytics and Optimization at EPFL. Before joining EPFL\, he
  was a faculty member at Imperial College London (2007-2013) and a postdoc
 toral researcher at Stanford University (2005-2006). He received a PhD in 
 Economics from the University of St. Gallen in 2004 and an MSc in Theoreti
 cal Physics from ETH Zurich in 1999. His research interests revolve around
  robust optimization and stochastic programming.\n\nTo participate:\nJoin

SUMMARY:YINS Seminar: Daniel Hsu (Columbia)

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nYINS Seminar\n\n“Contrastive learning\, 
 multi-view redundancy\, and linear models”\n\nSpeaker: Daniel Hsu\n\nCol
 umbia University\n\nAbstract:\nContrastive learning is a “self-supervise
 d” approach to representation learning that uses naturally occurring sim
 ilar and dissimilar pairs of data points to find useful embeddings of data
 . We study contrastive learning in the context of multi-view statistical m
 odels. First\, we show that whenever the views of the data are approximate
 ly redundant in their ability to predict a target function\, a low-dimensi
 onal embedding obtained via contrastive learning affords a linear predicto
 r with near-optimal predictive accuracy. Second\, we show that in the cont
 ext of topic models\, the embedding can be interpreted as a linear transfo
 rmation of the posterior moments of the hidden topic distribution given th
 e observed words. We also empirically demonstrate that linear classifiers 
 with these representations perform well in document classification tasks w
 ith very few labeled examples in a semi-supervised setting.\n\nThis is joi
 nt work with Akshay Krishnamurthy (MSR) and Christopher Tosh (Columbia).\n
 \nSpeaker Bio:\nDaniel Hsu is an associate professor in the Department of 
 Computer Science and a member of the Data Science Institute\, both at Colu
 mbia University. Previously\, he was a postdoc at Microsoft Research New E
 ngland\, and the Departments of Statistics at Rutgers University and the U
 niversity of Pennsylvania. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Sa
 n Diego\, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley.
  He was selected by IEEE Intelligent Systems as one of “AI’s 10 to Wat
 ch” in 2015 and received a 2016 Sloan Research Fellowship. Daniel’s re
 search interests are in algorithmic statistics and machine learning.\n\nTo
