DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us on Wednesday\, November 16 at 4 p.
 m. for a remarkable talk by journalist\nEsther Honig\n.\n\nIt was early sp
 ring\, nearly 15 years ago\, when Belen Delgado made the discovery of a li
 fetime. As a fisherman in rural Mexico\, Belen had a hunch that a giant ba
 nk of Callo de Hacha\, a rare and incredibly expensive shellfish\, lay jus
 t off the shore of his small coastal town. Together with friends\, he hire
 d a diver to plunge 70 feet below the surface and when he emerged the dive
 r confirmed Belen’s suspicion\, “wherever you step\,” he said\, “t
 here’s callo.” The colony of Callo de Hacha covered 30 miles of ocean 
 floor and was worth millions of dollars. This was the financial windfall t
 he town desperately needed\, but Belen wasn’t prepared for the chaos and
  greed that soon followed as his fellow fishermen succumbed to the “Whit
 e Gold Fever.” This story was produced for the podcast Snap Judgment in 
 partnership with FERN\, the Food and Environment Reporting Network. It exp
 lores overfishing\, climate change and the limitation of government regula
 tions when matched against the needs of people who are working to put food
  on the table.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zo
