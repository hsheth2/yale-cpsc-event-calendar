SUMMARY:Distinguished Lecturer Series\, Talk by Susan Hockfield
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210301T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210301T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished herself 
 in a career that has spanned advanced scientific research and the presiden
 cy of one of the premier institutions of science and engineering in the wo
 rld.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester a
 nd a Ph.D. from Georgetown University at the School of Medicine\, carrying
  out her doctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\, D
 r. Hockfield was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of Californ
 ia at San Francisco\n. She then joined the scientific staff at the\nCold S
 pring Harbor Laboratory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYale Univers
 ity\nin 1985\, Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the development of th
 e brain and on glioma\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneered t
 he use of monoclonal antibody technology demonstrating that early experien
 ce results in lasting changes in the molecular structure of the brain.  S
 he gained tenure in 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilbert Profess
 or of Neurobiology\n.\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong\, inn
 ovative university leader\, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts a
 nd Sciences\, with oversight of more than 70 graduate programs\, and then 
 as provost\, Yale’s chief academic and administrative officer.\n\nFrom D
 ecember 2004 through June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth pre
 sident of MIT\, where she continues to hold a faculty appointment as profe
 ssor of neuroscience and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative
  Cancer Research.\n\nZoom details to follow soon.\n\n\n\nUnder her leaders
 hip\, in 2006 MIT launched the\nMIT Energy Initiative\n(\nMITEI)\n\, rais
 ing more than $350 million to accelerate research\, policy and education 
 towards a sustainable energy future.  In recognition of MITEI’s momentu
 m\, in October 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a major energy a
 ddress at MIT and visited its research laboratories\, the first American P
 resident ever to do so.  In 2015\, she served as a member of a Congressio
 nal Commission evaluating the U.S. Department of Energy laboratories.\n\n\
 n\nAs the first life scientist to lead MIT\, she championed the breakthrou
 ghs emerging from the historic convergence of the life sciences with the e
 ngineering and physical sciences\, in fields from clean energy to cancer\,
  including the founding of MIT’s\nDavid H. Koch Institute for Integrati
 ve Cancer Research\,\nthe\nInstitute for Medical Engineering and Science\,
 \nand the\nRagon Institute of MGH\, MIT and Harvard\n.  Dr. Hockfield’s
  book\,\nThe Age of Living Machines\n(2019)\, focuses on this historic con
 vergence of the life sciences and engineering – a story that holds the p
 romise of overcoming some of the greatest humanitarian\, medical\, and env
 ironmental challenges of our time.\n\n\n\nLong an advocate for the researc
 h university as an engine of innovation and economic growth\, Dr. Hockfiel
 d also helped shape national policy on energy technology and next-generati
 on manufacturing.  In June 2011\, President Obama appointed her co-chair 
 of the steering committee of the\nAdvanced Manufacturing Partnership\n\, a
  working coalition of academic\, government and industry leaders.\n\n\n\nI
 n keeping with MIT’s entrepreneurial spirit and signature strength in wo
 rking with industry\, she actively fostered the burgeoning\nKendall Square
  innovation cluster\n\, populated by global giants and startups in the eme
 rging frontiers of biotech\, IT and energy\, with many tracing their roots
  to MIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield argued forcefully for the value of MIT’s\
 nglobal engagement\n.  She actively expanded the Institute’s internatio
 nal education and research activities.  Building on the success of MIT O
 penCourseWare in bringing high quality educational materials to learners t
 he world over\, in early 2012\, Dr. Hockfield accelerated the conversation
  around cost\, quality and access in higher education with the launch of\
 nMITx\n.  This online learning initiative offers a laboratory for experi
 menting with the use of new learning technologies and provides a portfoli
 o of MIT courses to a virtual community of learners around the planet.  
 Further amplifying its impact\, in May 2012\, MIT joined forces with Harv
 ard University to launch\nedX\n\, a partnership in online education with t
 he ambition to revolutionize learning on campus\, to offer first-rate tea
 ching to learners around the globe\, and to open unprecedented paths to le
 arning about learning itself.\n\n\n\nInternational research collaborations
  also grew under Dr. Hockfield’s leadership\, through new and expanded p
 artnerships around the globe\, from Abu Dhabi to Portugal\, and from Singa
 pore to Colombia.  MIT partnered to found several wholly new institution
 s\, including the\nSingapore University of Technology and Design\nand the
 \nMasdar Institute of Science and Technology\n.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield was 
 the first woman to lead MIT\, a development welcome at an Institute where 
 nearly half the undergraduates are now women. A signature of her presidenc
 y was her vocal commitment to making MIT a leader in building diversity al
 l along the pipeline of talent.  In November 2008\, she convened MIT’s 
 first-ever Diversity Leadership Congress\, a gathering of 300 leaders from
  across the Institute committed to cultivating a culture of inclusion that
  allows everyone to contribute at the peak of their ability.  These effor
 ts led to a marked increase in women and minority scholars joining the MIT
  faculty.\n\n\n\nBefore returning to MIT following her presidency\, Dr. Ho
 ckfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship at Harvard University
 ’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\, and the Carnegie Corporation/V
 artan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowship at the American Academy of Rome.  S
 he is an elected member of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\nand
  an elected fellow of the\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sci
 ence\n\, where she is the chairman.  She also serves as a director of the
 \nCharles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\, Part
 ners HealthCare System\,\nand the\nBelfer Center for Science and Internati
 onal Affairs\n\, and is a life member of the\nMIT Corporation\n.\nShe has 
 served as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey with the U.S. Department of Stat
 e.\n\nDr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees from many institutions\, includ
 ing\nBrown University\, Duke University\, Georgetown University\, Mt. Sina
 i School of Medicine\, Northeastern University\, Tsinghua University (Beij
 ing)\, Université Pierre et Marie Curie\, University of Edinburgh\, Univ
 ersity of Massachusetts Medical School\, University of Rochester\n\, and t
 he\nWatson School of Biological Sciences at the Cold Spring Harbor Laborat
 ory\n.  Her accomplishments have also been recognized by the Charles Juds
 on Herrick Award from the American Association of Anatomists\, the Wilbur 
 Lucius Cross Award from the Yale University Graduate School\, the Meliora 
 Citation from the University of Rochester\, the Golden Plate Award from th
 e Academy of Achievement\, the Amelia Earhart Award from the Women’s Uni
 on\, the Edison Achievement Award\, the Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achie
 vement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\, and the Geoffrey Been
 e Builders of Science Award from Research!America..\n\nDr. Hockfield lives
  in Cambridge with her husband\, Thomas N. Byrne\, M.D.  They have an adu
 lt daughter\, Elizabeth.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/distin
