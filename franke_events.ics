DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities at Yale is excited to announce the launch of the Franke Graduate St
 udent Research Award.  In summer 2022\, the Program will select a few int
 erdisciplinary research projects to receive funding of $2K each and $3K ea
 ch for postdoctoral fellows.  Preference will be given to scholars whose 
 areas of research and methods advance our mission of fostering communicati
 on\, mutual understanding\, collaborative research\, and teaching among di
 verse scientific and humanistic disciplines.  Funding should be used to d
 evelop an interdisciplinary aspect of a fellow’s current research progra
 m.\n\nPlease complete and submit the application below electronically to t
 he Program’s Assistant Director\, Ty Kamp (\nty.kamp@yale.edu\n)\, along
  with your project proposal\, by Friday\, July 15\, 2022.  Successful app
 licants will be informed by Friday\, August 19\, 2022.\n\nAcademic special
 ization increasingly leads to isolation among scholars and the disciplines
  they study\, resulting in misunderstanding and the erosion of common inte
 llectual goals.  We hold that this isolation is also a barrier to researc
 h progress on interdisciplinary questions situated between traditional are
 as of study.  The Franke Program in Science and the Humanities is founded
  on the twin convictions that the fundamental questions that engage humani
 sts must be informed by basic insights of science and that meaningful scie
 ntific inquiry depends on humanistic knowledge.  Our goal is to build an 
 intellectual community of scholars who think in a pan-disciplinary manner 
 as we believe that this mind-set generates original\, creative and innovat
 ive breakthroughs.  The Franke Program sponsors lectures\, colloquia\, co
 nferences\, undergraduate courses\, faculty seminars\, and performances\, 
 as well as independent research projects devised by undergraduate and grad
 uate students.  Once selected\, awardees are expected to participate in o
 ur public events and attend a dinner conversation and presentation once a 
 semester with the entire cohort of Franke undergraduate and graduate resea
 rch fellows.  Upon completion of the work\, a detailed summary of the pro
 ject and outcomes is to be submitted to the Program.  Note that all funde
 d projects must cite the support of The Franke Program in Science and the 
 Humanities in all advertising materials and products.\n\nFRANKE GRADUATE S
