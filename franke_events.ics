DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe
 l.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your exciting ideas!\n\n\nhttps://frankep

 ias in algorithms.\n\nImmediately following the screening\,\nProfessor Eli
 sa Celis\nwill moderate a discussion with the filmmaker\, Shalini Kantayya
 .\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Computation and Society Initiative

 alini Kantayya:\n\n\n\nFilmmaker Shalini Kantayya’s\nCoded Bias\npremier
 ed at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival to\ncritical acclaim\n.  Coded Bias
  was broadcast nationally on PBS Emmy-award winning series Independent Len
 s and will stream globally on Netflix in April 2021.  The film won a SIMA
  Award for Best Director and has been nominated for a Critics’ Choice\, 
 a Cinema Eye Honors\, and an NAACP Image Award\, among others. Shalini’s
  debut feature\,\nCatching the Sun\n\, premiered at the\nLA Film Festival\
 nand was named a\nNY Times Critics’ Pick\n.  Catching the Sun was rele
 ased globally on\nNetflix\non Earth Day 2016 with Executive Producer Leona
 rdo DiCaprio and was nominated for the Environmental Media Association Aw
 ard for Best Documentary.  She directed the season finale of the Nationa
 l Geographic television series\nBreakthrough\n\, Executive Produced by Ron
  Howard\, broadcast globally in June 2017.  She has also directed for NOV
 A and YouTube Originals.  Shalini is a\nTED Fellow\n\, a William J. Fulbr
 ight Scholar\, and an Associate of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Jour
 nalism.\n\nProfessor Elisa Celis:\n\nProfessor Elisa Celis is an assistant
  professor in the Statistics & Data Science department at Yale University.
   She studies the manifestation of social and economic biases in our onli
 ne lives via the algorithms that encode and perpetuate them.  Her work sp
 ans multiple disciplines including data science\, machine learning\, and t
 heoretical computer science with an emphasis on fairness and diversity in 
 artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Professor Celis’ researc
 h focuses on problems that arise at the interface of computation and machi
 ne learning and its societal and economic ramifications. She approaches th
 ese problems by using both experimental and theoretical techniques.  Her 
 work spans multiple areas including social computing and crowdsourcing\, d
 ata science\, and algorithm design with an emphasis on fairness and divers
 ity in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Her recent works in
 clude methodologies for debiasing data\, approaches to produce diverse ran
 king and recommendation systems\, mechanisms to avoid discrimination in ac
 cess to opportunity in online advertisements\, and the design of voting te
 chniques that allow for the election of diverse committees.\n\n\nhttps://f

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  “Are Scientific Models F
 ictions?  Model-Based Science as Epistemic Warfare”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210422T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210422T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nIn the current epistemological debate\, sc
 ientific models are not only considered as useful devices for explaining f
 acts or discovering new entities\, laws\, and theories\, but also rubricat
 ed under various new labels: from the classical ones\, as abstract entitie
 s and idealizations\, to the more recent\, as fictions\, surrogates\, cred
 ible worlds\, missing systems\, make-believe\, parables\, functional\, epi
 stemic actions\, revealing capacities. Professor Magnani of the University
  of Pavia in Italy will discuss these approaches showing some of their epi
 stemological inadequacies\, also taking advantage of recent results in cog
 nitive science. The main aim is to revise and criticize fictionalism\, als
 o reframing the received idea of abstractness and ideality of models with 
 the help of recent results coming from the area of distributed cognition (
 common coding) and abductive cognition (manipulative).  Professor Magnani
  will illustrate how scientific modeling activity can be better described 
 taking advantage of the concept of “epistemic warfare\,” which sees sc
 ientific enterprise as a complicated struggle for rational knowledge in wh
 ich it is crucial to distinguish epistemic (for example scientific models)
  from non-epistemic (for example fictions\, falsities\, propaganda) weapon
 s. Finally\, he will contend that it is misleading to analyze models in sc
 ience by adopting a confounding mixture of static and dynamic aspects of t
 he scientific enterprise. Scientific models in a static perspective (for e
 xample when inserted in a textbook) certainly appear fictional to the epis
 temologist\, but their fictional character disappears in case a dynamic pe
 rspective is adopted. A reference to the originative role of thought exper
 iment in Galileo’s discoveries and to the usefulness of Feyerabend’s c
 ounterinduction in criticizing the role of resemblance in model-based cogn
 ition is also provided\, to further enrich the answer to the question indi
 cated by the title of this talk.\n\nProfessor Jim Weatherall of UC Irvine 
 will lead a conversation with Professor Magnani the next day at 3 p.m.\n\n

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Lyanda Lynn Haupt\, “Mozart
 ’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Language\, and the Human Relationship with
  the Natural World”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMozart’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Lang
 uage\, and the Human Relationship with the Natural World\n\nThe story soun
 ds apocryphal\, but it’s actually true.  In the spring of 1784\, Mozart
  found a starling in a Viennese shop mimicking the motif from one of his o
 wn concertos\, and he took the bird home as a pet.  How did it come to pa
 ss that the sublime classical composer found inspiration in one of the wor
 ld’s most ecologically despised species?  The answer leads to a beautif
 ul tangle of music theory\, linguistics\, the nature of creative inspirati
 on\, and the human relationship with the wild earth.\n\nRegister in advanc
