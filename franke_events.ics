DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us for the 13th talk of Yale Quantum 
 Institute series of nontechnical talks aiming to bring a new regard to qua
 ntum physics and STEM by having experts cast new light on often-overlooked
  aspects of scientific work.\n\nYears ago\, physicist Stephon Alexander re
 ceived life-changing advice: to discover real physics\, he needed to stop 
 memorizing and start taking risks. For this public talk based on his book 
 Fear of a Black Universe\, Professor Alexander shows that great physics re
 quires us to think outside the mainstream – to improvise and rely on int
 uition. His approach led him to three principles that shape all theories o
 f the universe: the principle of invariance\, the quantum principle\, and 
 the principle of emergence. Professor Alexander uses them to explore some 
 of physics’ greatest mysteries\, from what happened before the big bang 
 to how the universe makes consciousness possible. Drawing on his experienc
 e as a Black physicist\, he makes a powerful case for diversifying our sci
 entific communities. Compelling and empowering\, Fear of a Black Universe 
 offers remarkable insight into the art of physics.\n\nDue to the Yale Covi
 d policies\, only members of the Yale Community can attend this event in p
 erson. The event will be livestreamed here for all to enjoy.\n\nREGISTER T

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nPlease note that we shall soon open our Gr
 aduate Student and Postdoctoral Fellowship competition.  The application 
 will be made available for both on this page in June.\n\nAcademic speciali
 zation increasingly leads to isolation among scholars and the disciplines 
 they study\, resulting in misunderstanding and the erosion of common intel
 lectual goals.  We hold that this isolation is also a barrier to research
  progress on interdisciplinary questions situated between traditional area
 s of study.  The Franke Program in Science and the Humanities is founded 
 on the twin convictions that the fundamental questions that engage humanis
 ts must be informed by basic insights of science and that meaningful scien
 tific inquiry in turn deepens with humanistic knowledge.\n\nWe plan to sel
 ect up to five interdisciplinary research projects to receive funding of $
 2\,000 each ($3\,000 per postdoctoral fellow) to be held during the academ
 ic year 2022-23.  We welcome proposals that advance our mission of foster
 ing communication\, mutual understanding\, collaborative research\, and te
 aching among diverse scientific and humanistic disciplines.  Research pro
 posals are required to have two faculty members from different departments
 /disciplines as intellectual mentors.  Letters of recommendation will be 
 requested from these faculty mentors for short-listed candidates.\n\n\nhtt
