DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nPlease note that we shall soon open our Gr
 aduate Student and Postdoctoral Fellowship competition.  The application 
 will be made available for both on this page in June.\n\nAcademic speciali
 zation increasingly leads to isolation among scholars and the disciplines 
 they study\, resulting in misunderstanding and the erosion of common intel
 lectual goals.  We hold that this isolation is also a barrier to research
  progress on interdisciplinary questions situated between traditional area
 s of study.  The Franke Program in Science and the Humanities is founded 
 on the twin convictions that the fundamental questions that engage humanis
 ts must be informed by basic insights of science and that meaningful scien
 tific inquiry in turn deepens with humanistic knowledge.\n\nWe plan to sel
 ect up to five interdisciplinary research projects to receive funding of $
 2\,000 each ($3\,000 per postdoctoral fellow) to be held during the academ
 ic year 2022-23.  We welcome proposals that advance our mission of foster
 ing communication\, mutual understanding\, collaborative research\, and te
 aching among diverse scientific and humanistic disciplines.  Research pro
 posals are required to have two faculty members from different departments
 /disciplines as intellectual mentors.  Letters of recommendation will be 
 requested from these faculty mentors for short-listed candidates.\n\n\nhtt
