 covid-19-information\n\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished herself in a car
 eer that has spanned advanced scientific research and the presidency of on
 e of the premier institutions of science and engineering in the world.\n\n
 After earning a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester and a Ph.
 D. from Georgetown University at the School of Medicine\, carrying out her
  doctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\, Dr. Hockf
 ield was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of California at Sa
 n Francisco\n. She then joined the scientific staff at the\nCold Spring Ha
 rbor Laboratory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYale University\nin 
 1985\, Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the development of the brain 
 and on glioma\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneered the use o
 f monoclonal antibody technology demonstrating that early experience resul
 ts in lasting changes in the molecular structure of the brain.  She gaine
 d tenure in 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilbert Professor of Ne
 urobiology\n.\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong\, innovative 
 university leader\, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts and Scien
 ces\, with oversight of more than 70 graduate programs\, and then as provo
 st\, Yale’s chief academic and administrative officer.\n\nFrom December 
 2004 through June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth president o
 f MIT\, where she continues to hold a faculty appointment as professor of 
 neuroscience and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer 
 Research.\n\n\nUnder her leadership\, in 2006 MIT launched the\nMIT Energ
 y Initiative\n(\nMITEI)\n\, raising more than $350 million to accelerate 
 research\, policy and education towards a sustainable energy future.  In 
 recognition of MITEI’s momentum\, in October 2009 U.S. President Barack 
 Obama delivered a major energy address at MIT and visited its research lab
 oratories\, the first American President ever to do so.  In 2015\, she se
 rved as a member of a Congressional Commission evaluating the U.S. Departm
 ent of Energy laboratories.\n\n\n\nAs the first life scientist to lead MIT
 \, she championed the breakthroughs emerging from the historic convergence
  of the life sciences with the engineering and physical sciences\, in fiel
 ds from clean energy to cancer\, including the founding of MIT’s\nDavid
  H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research\,\nthe\nInstitute for M
 edical Engineering and Science\,\nand the\nRagon Institute of MGH\, MIT an
 d Harvard\n.  Dr. Hockfield’s book\,\nThe Age of Living Machines\n(2019
 )\, focuses on this historic convergence of the life sciences and engineer
 ing – a story that holds the promise of overcoming some of the greatest 
 humanitarian\, medical\, and environmental challenges of our time.\n\n\n\n
 Long an advocate for the research university as an engine of innovation an
 d economic growth\, Dr. Hockfield also helped shape national policy on ene
 rgy technology and next-generation manufacturing.  In June 2011\, Preside
 nt Obama appointed her co-chair of the steering committee of the\nAdvanced
  Manufacturing Partnership\n\, a working coalition of academic\, governmen
 t and industry leaders.\n\n\n\nIn keeping with MIT’s entrepreneurial spi
 rit and signature strength in working with industry\, she actively fostere
 d the burgeoning\nKendall Square innovation cluster\n\, populated by globa
 l giants and startups in the emerging frontiers of biotech\, IT and energy
 \, with many tracing their roots to MIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield argued forc
 efully for the value of MIT’s\nglobal engagement\n.  She actively expan
 ded the Institute’s international education and research activities.  B
 uilding on the success of MIT OpenCourseWare in bringing high quality edu
 cational materials to learners the world over\, in early 2012\, Dr. Hockfi
 eld accelerated the conversation around cost\, quality and access in high
 er education with the launch of\nMITx\n.  This online learning initiative
  offers a laboratory for experimenting with the use of new learning techn
 ologies and provides a portfolio of MIT courses to a virtual community o
 f learners around the planet.  Further amplifying its impact\, in May 20
 12\, MIT joined forces with Harvard University to launch\nedX\n\, a partne
 rship in online education with the ambition to revolutionize learning on 
 campus\, to offer first-rate teaching to learners around the globe\, and t
 o open unprecedented paths to learning about learning itself.\n\n\n\nInter
 national research collaborations also grew under Dr. Hockfield’s leaders
 hip\, through new and expanded partnerships around the globe\, from Abu Dh
 abi to Portugal\, and from Singapore to Colombia.  MIT partnered to found
  several wholly new institutions\, including the\nSingapore University o
 f Technology and Design\nand the\nMasdar Institute of Science and Technolo
 gy\n.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield was the first woman to lead MIT\, a developmen
 t welcome at an Institute where nearly half the undergraduates are now wom
 en. A signature of her presidency was her vocal commitment to making MIT a
  leader in building diversity all along the pipeline of talent.  In Novem
 ber 2008\, she convened MIT’s first-ever Diversity Leadership Congress\,
  a gathering of 300 leaders from across the Institute committed to cultiva
 ting a culture of inclusion that allows everyone to contribute at the peak
  of their ability.  These efforts led to a marked increase in women and m
 inority scholars joining the MIT faculty.\n\n\nBefore returning to MIT fol
 lowing her presidency\, Dr. Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Profe
 ssorship at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\, 
 and the Carnegie Corporation/Vartan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowship at the
  American Academy of Rome.  She is an elected member of the\nAmerican Aca
 demy of Arts and Sciences\nand an elected fellow of the\nAmerican Associat
 ion for the Advancement of Science\n\, where she is the chairman.  She al
 so serves as a director of the\nCharles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\,\nCounc
 il on Foreign Relations\, Partners HealthCare System\,\nand the\nBelfer Ce
 nter for Science and International Affairs\n\, and is a life member of the
 \nMIT Corporation\n.\nShe has served as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey wi
 th the U.S. Department of State.\n\nDr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees f
 rom many institutions\, including\nBrown University\, Duke University\, Ge
 orgetown University\, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine\, Northeastern Universi
 ty\, Tsinghua University (Beijing)\, Université Pierre et Marie Curie\, 
 University of Edinburgh\, University of Massachusetts Medical School\, Uni
 versity of Rochester\n\, and the\nWatson School of Biological Sciences at 
 the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\n.  Her accomplishments have also been 
 recognized by the Charles Judson Herrick Award from the American Associati
 on of Anatomists\, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Award from the Yale University 
 Graduate School\, the Meliora Citation from the University of Rochester\, 
 the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement\, the Amelia Earhar
 t Award from the Women’s Union\, the Edison Achievement Award\, the Pin
 nacle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Co
 mmerce\, and the Geoffrey Beene Builders of Science Award from Research!Am
 erica..\n\nDr. Hockfield lives in Cambridge with her husband\, Thomas N. B
 yrne\, M.D.  They have an adult daughter\, Elizabeth.\n\n\nhttps://frank
