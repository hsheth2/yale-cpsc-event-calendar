 he Program will select a few interdisciplinary research projects to receiv
 e funding of $3K each.  Preference will be given to scholars whose areas 
 of research and methods advance our mission of fostering communication\, m
 utual understanding\, collaborative research\, and teaching among diverse 
 scientific and humanistic disciplines.  Funding should be used to develop
  an interdisciplinary aspect of a fellow’s current research program.  A
 wards are made upon evaluation of the submitted proposals by a selection c
 ommittee that includes the Director of the Program and members of the Fran
 ke Program Advisory Board (\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/people\n).  P

 ugust 20\, 2020.  Fellows should be prepared to present their projects in
  a virtual gathering this fall.\n\nAcademic specialization increasingly le
 ads to isolation among scholars and the disciplines they study\, resulting
  in misunderstanding and the erosion of common intellectual goals.  We ho
 ld that this isolation is also a barrier to research progress on interdisc
 iplinary questions situated between traditional areas of study.  The Fran
 ke Program in Science and the Humanities is founded on the twin conviction
 s that the fundamental questions that engage humanists must be informed by
  basic insights of science and that meaningful scientific inquiry depends 
 on humanistic knowledge.  Our goal is to build an intellectual community 
 of scholars who think in a pan-disciplinary manner as we believe that this
  mind-set generates original\, creative and innovative breakthroughs.  Th
 e Franke Program sponsors lectures\, colloquia\, conferences\, undergradua
 te courses\, faculty seminars\, and performances\, as well as independent 
 research projects devised by undergraduate and graduate students.  Once s
 elected\, awardees are expected to attend a dinner conversation and presen
 tation once a semester with the entire cohort of Franke undergraduate and 
 graduate research fellows.  Upon completion of the work\, a detailed summ
 ary of the project and outcomes is to be submitted to the Program.  Note 
 that all funded projects must cite the support of The Franke Program in Sc
 ience and the Humanities in all advertising materials and products.\n\nFRA
