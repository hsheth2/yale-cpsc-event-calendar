DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us on Monday\, July 19 for an Inferen
 ce Project talk by Professor Elise Crull of The Department of Philosophy a
 t City University of New York.\n\nUnderstanding the sorts of explanations 
 and inferences that causal processes countenance is of course of great int
 erest to philosophers and physicists (among others).  But what can be sai
 d about physical processes that\nfail\nto exhibit classical causal structu
 re? Indefinite causal ordering among events made possible by quantum corre
 lations has become a fruitful arena of study recently\, yielding new insig
 hts for quantum computing and communication\, approaches to quantum gravit
 y\, and even for foundational issues in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn this talk
 \, Professor Elise Crull will focus on how indefinite causal ordering may 
 provide deeper understanding regarding the central property of quantum mec
 hanics: entanglement.  She will then consider what this case study might 
 imply regarding traditional philosophical views of cause as a relation bet
 ween independent events.\n\nRegister in advance for this meeting and for t
 he following day’s moderated conversation with Professor Yemima Ben-Mena
 hem of the\nDepartment of Philosophy at\nThe Hebrew University of Jerusale
 m.\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJckdOmqpjwuGNTol7KszO3Az816nI
 xQka…\n\n\n\nAfter registering\, you will receive a confirmation email c
 ontaining information about joining the meeting.\n\n\n\nAfter studying phy
 sics and astronomy at Calvin University\, Professor Crull took the plunge 
 into interdisciplinary waters\, earning both an M.A. and Ph.D in History &
  Philosophy of Science from the University of Notre Dame. Before coming to
  CUNY in 2014\, she held postdoctoral positions at the University of Aberd
 een and at the Hebrew University’s Edelstein Center for History & Philos
 ophy of Science\, Technology and Medicine (where she spent many blissful h
 ours huddled over documents in the Einstein Archives).\nWhile most of her 
 research to date concerns historical and philosophical foundations of qua
 ntum mechanics\, Crull is also drawn to questions in the hinterland betwee
 n contemporary metaphysics and physics.  In particular\, she is intereste
 d in the philosophical implications of entanglement and quantum decoherenc
 e – how these phenomena modify traditional views about the structure of 
 space and time\, and what explanatory roles they might play within various
  approaches to quantum gravity.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nUnderstanding the sorts of explanations an
 d inferences that causal processes countenance is of course of great inter
 est to philosophers and physicists (among others).  But what can be said a
 bout physical processes that fail to exhibit classical causal structure? I
 ndefinite causal ordering among events made possible by quantum correlatio
 ns has become a fruitful arena of study recently\, yielding new insights f
 or quantum computing and communication\, approaches to quantum gravity\, a
 nd even for foundational issues in quantum mechanics.\nIn this talk\, Prof
 essor Elise Crull will focus on how indefinite causal ordering may provide
  deeper understanding regarding the central property of quantum mechanics:
  entanglement.  She will then consider what this case study might imply re
 garding traditional philosophical views of cause as a relation between ind
 ependent events.\nRegister in advance for this meeting and for the followi

 essor Elise Crull will focus on how indefinite causal ordering may provide
  deeper understanding regarding the central property of quantum mechanics:
  entanglement.  She will then consider what this case study might imply re

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nUnderstanding the sorts of explanations an
 d inferences that causal processes countenance is of course of great inter
 est to philosophers and physicists (among others).  But what can be said a
 bout physical processes that fail to exhibit classical causal structure? I
 ndefinite causal ordering among events made possible by quantum correlatio
 ns has become a fruitful arena of study recently\, yielding new insights f
 or quantum computing and communication\, approaches to quantum gravity\, a
 nd even for foundational issues in quantum mechanics.\nIn this talk\, Prof
 essor Elise Crull will focus on how indefinite causal ordering may provide
  deeper understanding regarding the central property of quantum mechanics:
  entanglement.  She will then consider what this case study might imply re
 garding traditional philosophical views of cause as a relation between ind
