DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nTheoretical approaches have always played 
 an important role in biology\, dating back to Mendel’s peas. In today’
 s era of genomics and big data in biology\, statistical and computational
  tools are even more vital for biologists seeking to infer causation in li
 ving systems. To illustrate the range of methods\, from modelling to machi
 ne learning\, and how they contribute to understanding biological mechanis
 ms\, Dr. Teichmann will pick examples from some of the core problems her 
 lab has been investigating as case studies. Starting with the assembly of 
 proteins into complexes\, she will move on to the single cell revolution i
 n genomics and her quest to develop cell atlases of the human body. She w
 ill finish with her work leveraging these atlases to understand how COVID-
 19 affects the body. The examples will show how intertwined and complement
 ary ‘wet’ (i.e. experimental) and ‘dry’ (i.e. computational/theore
 tical) approaches are in today’s biology.\n\nThe conversant for the Augu
 st 31\, 2021 discussion will be\nNeil Lawrence\n\, the inaugural DeepMind 
 Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge.  He has bee
 n working on machine learning models for over 20 years.  He recently retu
 rned to academia after three years as Director of Machine Learning at Amaz
 on.  Professor Lawrence’s main interest is the interaction of machine l
 earning with the physical world.  This interest was triggered by deployin
 g machine learning in the African context\, where ‘end-to-end’ solutio
 ns are normally required.  This has inspired new research directions at t
 he interface of machine learning and systems research\, this work is funde
 d by a Senior AI Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute.  Professor La
 wrence is also visiting Professor at the University of Sheffield and the c
 o-host of Talking Machines.\n\nRegister in advance for this meeting and th
 e August 31 discussion:\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUlc-Gvq

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nSince March 2020\, The Franke Program in S
 cience and the Humanities has continued our robust programming schedule wi
 th virtual talks.  We have been delighted to note the large number of att
 endees for each and the interest many have expressed in seeing the videos 
 of the talks.  Please note that most of our sessions are recorded\, and t
