SUMMARY:Inference Project Virtual Talk:  Causality at the Intersection of 
 Simulation\, Inference\, Science\, and Learning
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220309T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220309T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe sciences are replete with high-fidelit
 y simulators:  computational manifestations of causal\, mechanistic model
 s.  Ironically\, while these simulators provide our highest-fidelity phys
 ical models\, they are not well suited for inferring properties of the mod
 el from data.  Professor Kyle Cranmer of New York University will describ
 e the emerging area of simulation-based inference and describe how machine
  learning is being brought to bear on these challenging problems.  It is 
 then tempting to imagine the path towards developing an autonomous AI scie
 ntist also responsible for designing experiments and hypothesis generation
 .  Interestingly\, this framing brings a new perspective on the role of c
 ausality and agency that incorporates recent advances in machine learning 
 and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe moderated post-talk conversation\nwill
  take place one week later on\nWednesday\, March 16 at 4 p.m.  Dr. Zenna 
 Tavares\, Associate Research Scientist at the Zuckerman Institute and Data
  Science Institute of Columbia University\, will be the conversant.\n\nReg

SUMMARY:Virtual Talk by Carl Zimmer - Life’s Edge:  The Search for What 
 it Means to be Alive
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220330T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220330T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe look forward to hosting a virtual talk 
 by Carl Zimmer\, renowened science writer and author of the “Matter” c
 olumn at\nThe New York Times\n.  His latest book\,\nLife’s Edge:  The 
 Search for What it Means to be Alive\n\, will be the subject of this talk.
 \n\nIn 1708\, the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl posed a question. “Above all
  else\, consequently\, it comes down to this–to know\, what is life?”\
 n\nIn 2018\, the biologists Francis Westall and André Brack took stock of
  what science had learned over the intervening three centuries: “It is c
 ommonly said that there as many definitions of life as there are people tr
 ying to define it.”\n\nIn\nLife’s Edge\,\nCarl Zimmer explores the nat
 ure of life and investigates why scientists have struggled to draw its bou
 ndaries. He handles pythons\, goes spelunking to visit hibernating bats\, 
 and even tries his hand at evolution. Zimmer visits scientists making mini
 ature human brains to ask when life begins\, and follows a voyage that del
 ivered microscopic animals to the moon\, where they now exist in a state b
 etween life and death. From the coronavirus to consciousness\, Zimmer demo
 nstrates that biology\, for all its advances\, has yet to achieve its grea
 test triumph: a full theory of life.\n\n\n\nRegister in advance for this w

SUMMARY:Mapping a Polycentric History of Renaissance Sound\, Virtual Talk
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220412T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220412T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe act of creating an inclusive and conne
 ctive network of all musical practices – sung\, played\, written\, and u
 nwritten ­– quickly reveals flaws in the hierarchies and priorities tha
 t have largely mapped the geography of Early Modern music history.  But s
 uch charting can also offer the chance for revision\, that is\, to move ac
 ross the historically constructed (and still not outdated) boundaries of 
 “central” and “peripheral” styles\, “greater” and “lesser”
  composers\, singular and plural modes of performance\, notated and improv
 ised practices\, and the border between original compositions and their ad
 aptations.  In this talk\, Professor Victor Coelho of Boston University p
 roposes a more “polycentric” template for understanding music history 
 between ca. 1420-1600\, drawing on several case-studies dealing with perfo
 rmance\, sound\, notation\, and transmission as examples of why a history 
 formed of many discrete parts with their individual stylistic constellatio
 ns may be preferable than attempts at constructing a unified musical unive
 rse.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/webi
