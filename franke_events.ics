DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe
 l.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your exciting ideas!\n\n\nhttps://frankep

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  “On Experiments for Caus
 al Inference and System Identification”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210317T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210317T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nIn the first part of his presentation\, Pr
 ofessor Ay will provide an introduction to the field of causal networks. H
 e will focus on instructive simple examples in order to highlight the core
  conceptual and philosophical ideas that underlie the theory. This approac
 h provides a clear semantics that allows us to distinguish between causati
 on and correlation. It also allows us to study how cause-effect relations 
 give rise to particular kinds of correlations\, which can then be exploite
 d for inferring causal relations from correlations. However\, this kind of
  inference\, which is based on observations only\, turns out to be rather 
 limited. In addition to observing a system\, one can also apply experiment
 al interventions and thereby reveal causal structures that would not follo
 w from correlational information.  This is one instance of system identif
 ication through experimental perturbations. Professor Ay will conclude his
  presentation with an extension of the interventional calculus by a “kno
 ckout calculus\,” which is based on a kind of structural intervention. T
 his allows us to reveal a more fine-grained causal description of the unde
 rlying system.\n\nRegister in advance for this meeting:\n\nhttps://yale.zo

 r Columbus lived the vast majority of his life in a Mediterranean world in
  which the Ottoman and Mamluk Empires dominated the eastern part of the se

 ion with the Christian states of Europe. This talk considers the importanc
 e of Islam in shaping Columbus’s life and voyages. In doing so\, it thin
 ks critically about the role of Islam in the Spanish decision to send him 
 across the ocean and in the early history of the Spanish Caribbean. It fur
 thermore uses this Muslim history of Columbus to suggest ways of analyzing
  early modern periodization and the place of Islam in the making of the mo
 dern world.\n\n\n\nAlan Mikhail is a historian of the early modern Muslim 
 world\, the Ottoman Empire\, and Egypt whose research and teaching focus m

 v Ranis and Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Prizes.\n\n\n\nProfessor Mikhail curr
 ently serves on the editorial boards of Cambridge Studies in Islamic Civil
 ization and the Palgrave Macmillan Series in World Environmental History\,

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Lyanda Lynn Haupt\, Author of
  Mozart’s Starling
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDetails to follow soon.  More on the subj
 ect of Lyanda’s book and talk topic follows:\n\n“The story of the comp
 oser and his pet bird led me on an unexpected journey to Vienna and Salzbu
 rg. It led me into the workings of the symphony\, the opera\, ornithologic
 al labs\, the depths of music theory\, the field of linguistics\, and the 
 nature of creative inspiration. It led me to the crazy experience of raisi
 ng a starling in my own home. It led me deep into the spirit of the natura
 l world and our constant wild animal companions.\nIt led me to the underst
 anding that there is more possibility in our relationships with animals—
 with all the creatures of the earth\, not just the traditionally beautiful
 \, or endangered\, or loved—than I had ever imagined.”\n\nRegister in
