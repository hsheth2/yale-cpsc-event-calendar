SUMMARY:Mapping a Polycentric History of Renaissance Sound\, Virtual Talk
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220412T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220412T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe act of creating an inclusive and conne
 ctive network of all musical practices – sung\, played\, written\, and u
 nwritten ­– quickly reveals flaws in the hierarchies and priorities tha
 t have largely mapped the geography of Early Modern music history.  But s
 uch charting can also offer the chance for revision\, that is\, to move ac
 ross the historically constructed (and still not outdated) boundaries of 
 “central” and “peripheral” styles\, “greater” and “lesser”
  composers\, singular and plural modes of performance\, notated and improv
 ised practices\, and the border between original compositions and their ad
 aptations.  In this talk\, Professor Victor Coelho of Boston University p
 roposes a more “polycentric” template for understanding music history 
 between ca. 1420-1600\, drawing on several case-studies dealing with perfo
 rmance\, sound\, notation\, and transmission as examples of why a history 
 formed of many discrete parts with their individual stylistic constellatio
 ns may be preferable than attempts at constructing a unified musical unive
 rse.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/webi

SUMMARY:Collective Pulse: Uncovering the Hidden Lives of Animals through M
 usic Theory and Artificial Intelligence
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220420T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220420T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe are delighted to present a talk by Dieg
 o Ellis-Soto\, a current Franke Fellow now in his second year with our pro
 gram.\n\nThe movement of large groups of animals – such as flocks of bir
 ds or schooling of fish – often appears harmonic and soothing to the eye
 \, almost as if animal collectives were dancing to some musical rules not 
 visible to the human eye.  Yet at the same time\, the sound of the natura
 l world is increasingly shaped by the timber of the drums of human activit
 ies and habitat destruction across the world.  In this talk\, Ellis-Soto 
 combines new cutting edge technology\, with biological principles and musi
 cal theory to take a dive into representing the lives of animal collective
 s through art and music.  From music on a farm\, art exhibitions\, up to 
 involving of local youth\, we invite you to take the plunge into the sound
 s of animals collectives and ecosystems.\n\nRegister in advance for this w
