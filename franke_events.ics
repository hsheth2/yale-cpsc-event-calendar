SUMMARY:White Gold Fever:  The Story of Deep Sea Treasure and Environmenta

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us on ZOOM on Wednesday\, November 16
  at 4 p.m. for a remarkable talk by journalist\nEsther Honig\n.\n\nIt was 
 early spring\, nearly 15 years ago\, when Belen Delgado made the discovery
  of a lifetime. As a fisherman in rural Mexico\, Belen had a hunch that a 
 giant bank of Callo de Hacha\, a rare and incredibly expensive shellfish\,
  lay just off the shore of his small coastal town. Together with friends\,
  he hired a diver to plunge 70 feet below the surface and when he emerged 
 the diver confirmed Belen’s suspicion\, “wherever you step\,” he sai
 d\, “there’s callo.” The colony of Callo de Hacha covered 30 miles o
 f ocean floor and was worth millions of dollars. This was the financial wi
 ndfall the town desperately needed\, but Belen wasn’t prepared for the c
 haos and greed that soon followed as his fellow fishermen succumbed to the
  “White Gold Fever.” This story was produced for the podcast Snap Judg
 ment in partnership with FERN\, the Food and Environment Reporting Network
 . It explores overfishing\, climate change and the limitation of governmen
 t regulations when matched against the needs of people who are working to 
 put food on the table.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps:/
