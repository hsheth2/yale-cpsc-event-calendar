DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe
 l.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your exciting ideas!\n\n\nhttps://frankep

SUMMARY:Ornament’s Refracted Cosmologies Colloquium Event
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210426T223000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210426T233000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Making Ornament:  Past\, Present\, and
  Future”\n\npresented by\nMatthew McNicholas and Gary He\nand moderated 
 by Kassandra Leiva and Misha Semenov\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Yal
 e School of Architecture\, The Franke Program in Science and the Humanitie
 s\, and the MacMillan Center at Yale.\n\nThe event is open to anyone inter
 ested in the topic of Ornament. There will be substantial time for an acti
 ve Q&A after the presentations.\n\nBelow is a description of the event:\n\
 nThroughout history\, ornament has served as an expression of specific cul
 tures and historical moments. How does a designer with full access to thes
 e archives of history create ornament relevant in today’s world of digit
 al fabrication? In this session\, an ornament designer with a keen sensiti
 vity for history and a great interest in neuroscience will converse with a
  scholar of ornament’s history. Together\, they will examine the unique 
 spatial powers of ornament and its effects on viewers past\, present\, and
  future on a cultural and neurological level.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.y

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Lyanda Lynn Haupt\, “Mozart
 ’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Language\, and the Human Relationship with
  the Natural World”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMozart’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Lang
 uage\, and the Human Relationship with the Natural World\n\nThe story soun
 ds apocryphal\, but it’s actually true.  In the spring of 1784\, Mozart
  found a starling in a Viennese shop mimicking the motif from one of his o
 wn concertos\, and he took the bird home as a pet.  How did it come to pa
 ss that the sublime classical composer found inspiration in one of the wor
 ld’s most ecologically despised species?  The answer leads to a beautif
 ul tangle of music theory\, linguistics\, the nature of creative inspirati
 on\, and the human relationship with the wild earth.\n\nRegister in advanc
 e for this meeting\nhere\n(\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwqcui
