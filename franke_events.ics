SUMMARY:Pathways to a Sustainable Future
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n**Zoom link to follow soon.**\n\nSustainab
 ility has emerged as a global priority over the past several years with im
 portant commitments made through the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Chang
 e and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. But political divides\, re
 gional disputes\, and deep disagreements over core principles have made it
  nearly impossible to chart a course toward a sustainable future. This tal
 k will highlight fresh thinking on sustainability from a new book that eme
 rged from a multi-year initiative from the Yale School of the Environment 
 that engaged a diverse set of environmental thought leaders from diverse d
 isciplines and across the political spectrum. The book’s 40 essays cover
  such subjects as innovation\, communications\, environmental justice\, Bi
 g Data\, public health\, and climate change — all with an emphasis on id
 entifying pathways to a sustainability future.\n\nDan Esty is the Hillhous
 e Professor of Environmental Law and Policy at Yale’s School of the Envi
 ronment and Yale Law School. He served as head of the Connecticut Departme
 nt of Energy and Environmental Protection from 2011 to 2014 and in several
  leadership roles at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from 1989 to
  1993.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/pathways-sustainable-futu
