SUMMARY:Inference Project Virtual Talk:  Causality at the Intersection of 
 Simulation\, Inference\, Science\, and Learning
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220308T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220308T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe sciences are replete with high-fidelit
 y simulators:  computational manifestations of causal\, mechanistic model
 s.  Ironically\, while these simulators provide our highest-fidelity phys
 ical models\, they are not well suited for inferring properties of the mod
 el from data.  Professor Kyle Cranmer of New York University will describ
 e the emerging area of simulation-based inference and describe how machine
  learning is being brought to bear on these challenging problems.  It is 
 then tempting to imagine the path towards developing an autonomous AI scie
 ntist also responsible for designing experiments and hypothesis generation
 .  Interestingly\, this framing brings a new perspective on the role of c
 ausality and agency that incorporates recent advances in machine learning 
 and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe moderated post-talk conversation with\
 nZenna Tavares\n\,\nassociate research scientist and Alan Kanzer Innovatio
 n Scholar\nat the Zuckerman Institute and Data Science Institute of Columb
 ia University\, is\nexpected to take place on Wednesday\, March 9 at 4 p.m
 .  Confirmation of this date will follow soon.\n\nRegister in advance for

SUMMARY:Franke Undergraduate Fellowship Grants for 2021/2022
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T224500
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T234500
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
