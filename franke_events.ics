 _id=434b72d3db9e8f…\n\nSustainability has emerged as a global priority o
 ver the past several years with important commitments made through the 201
 5 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the UN’s Sustainable Development
  Goals. But political divides\, regional disputes\, and deep disagreements
  over core principles have made it nearly impossible to chart a course tow
 ard a sustainable future. This talk will highlight fresh thinking on susta
 inability from a new book that emerged from a multi-year initiative from t
 he Yale School of the Environment that engaged a diverse set of environmen
 tal thought leaders from diverse disciplines and across the political spec
 trum. The book’s 40 essays cover such subjects as innovation\, communica
 tions\, environmental justice\, Big Data\, public health\, and climate cha
 nge — all with an emphasis on identifying pathways to a sustainability f
 uture.\n\nDan Esty is the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Pol
 icy at Yale’s School of the Environment and Yale Law School. He served a
 s head of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protectio
 n from 2011 to 2014 and in several leadership roles at the U.S. Environmen
 tal Protection Agency from 1989 to 1993.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.e
