SUMMARY:Virtual Talk by Carl Zimmer - Life’s Edge:  The Search for What 
 it Means to be Alive
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220330T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220330T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe look forward to hosting a virtual talk 
 by Carl Zimmer\, renowened science writer and author of the “Matter” c
 olumn at\nThe New York Times\n.  His latest book\,\nLife’s Edge:  The 
 Search for What it Means to be Alive\n\, will be the subject of this talk.
 \n\nIn 1708\, the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl posed a question. “Above all
  else\, consequently\, it comes down to this–to know\, what is life?”\
 n\nIn 2018\, the biologists Francis Westall and André Brack took stock of
  what science had learned over the intervening three centuries: “It is c
 ommonly said that there as many definitions of life as there are people tr
 ying to define it.”\n\nIn\nLife’s Edge\,\nCarl Zimmer explores the nat
 ure of life and investigates why scientists have struggled to draw its bou
 ndaries. He handles pythons\, goes spelunking to visit hibernating bats\, 
 and even tries his hand at evolution. Zimmer visits scientists making mini
 ature human brains to ask when life begins\, and follows a voyage that del
 ivered microscopic animals to the moon\, where they now exist in a state b
 etween life and death. From the coronavirus to consciousness\, Zimmer demo
 nstrates that biology\, for all its advances\, has yet to achieve its grea
 test triumph: a full theory of life.\n\n\n\nRegister in advance for this w

SUMMARY:Mapping a Polycentric History of Renaissance Sound\, Virtual Talk
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220412T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220412T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe act of creating an inclusive and conne
 ctive network of all musical practices – sung\, played\, written\, and u
 nwritten ­– quickly reveals flaws in the hierarchies and priorities tha
 t have largely mapped the geography of Early Modern music history.  But s
 uch charting can also offer the chance for revision\, that is\, to move ac
 ross the historically constructed (and still not outdated) boundaries of 
 “central” and “peripheral” styles\, “greater” and “lesser”
  composers\, singular and plural modes of performance\, notated and improv
 ised practices\, and the border between original compositions and their ad
 aptations.  In this talk\, Professor Victor Coelho of Boston University p
 roposes a more “polycentric” template for understanding music history 
 between ca. 1420-1600\, drawing on several case-studies dealing with perfo
 rmance\, sound\, notation\, and transmission as examples of why a history 
 formed of many discrete parts with their individual stylistic constellatio
 ns may be preferable than attempts at constructing a unified musical unive
 rse.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/webi
