DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210924T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThere has been an enormous burgeoning of i
 nterest in causation across the science. One can open up a journal in micr
 obiology and be assailed with detailed models of  the causal structure of
  cells and proteins. One can find textbooks on the increasing array comput
 ational tools for causal search and discovery\,and take classes devoted to
  formal methods in causal modeling. Psychologists are unraveling new detai
 ls about how people use causal concepts in reasoning. While details of the
 se kinds are in abundant supply\, it remains a contested question what cau
 sation is and how it fits into a physics-based ontology. In this talk\, Pr
 ofessor Ismael is going to assemble the pieces of emerging scientific unde
 rstanding of causation into an account of where (and  how) causation aris
 es in the architecture of the cosmos\, with special attention to the conte
 sted questions of where the direction of causation comes from and its rela
 tionship agency.\n\nProfessor Jenann Ismael joined the faculty at Columbia
  University in 2018.  Most of her work falls into two classes. The first
  class circumscribes central concerns of the philosophy of physics. Intere
 sts there include the structure of space and time\, the foundations of qua
 ntum mechanics\, the role of simplicity and symmetry in physics\, question
 s about the nature of probability\, natural laws and causal relations. The
  second class includes mind\, cognition\, phenomenology\, and the nature o
 f perspective.\n\n\nProfessor Ismael received her Ph.D. from Princeton Uni
 versity\, was a Mellon Fellow at Stanford\, and taught at the University o
 f Arizona before coming to Columbia.  She has held a number of prestigiou
 s fellowships\, including an NEH fellowship at the National Humanities Cen
 ter\, a Queen Elizabeth II Research Fellowship from the Australian Researc
 h Council\, and fellowships from the Templeton Foundation and CASBS (Cente
 r for Advanced Studies in Behavioral Science at Stanford).\n\n\n\nJames Wo
 odward\, Distinguished Professor in the Department of the History and Phil
 osophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh\, will moderate a post-t
 alk conversation with Professor Ismael on September 25.  Before coming t
 o Pittsburgh in the fall of 2010\, Professor Woodward was J.O. and Juliett
 e Koepfli Professor of Humanities at the California Institute of Technolog
 y.  His research covers a number of different areas\, including theories 
 of causation\, explanation and inductive inference in general philosophy o
 f science\, philosophy of psychology\, and philosophy of social science. 
  His interests in psychology include the empirical psychology of causal le
 arning and judgment\; in this connection he is a participant in a multidis
 ciplinary collaboration sponsored by the McDonnell foundation that explore
 s the relation between formal theories of causal inference and the inferen
 ces adults and children actually make.  Professor Woodward also maintains
  an interest in moral psychology and the empirical study of human behavior
  in morally significant situations.\n\n\n\n\nRegister in advance for this

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nI Prove a Theorem and the House Expands: 
  Geometry and Poetry\n\nWe are delighted that famed author and mathematic
 ian\nJordan Ellenberg\nwill be joining us for a virtual talk this semester
 .  In his words\, our speaker wrote a book about geometry and found himse
 lf\, surprisingly\, constantly talking about poetry.  In this talk\, he w
 ill cover various subjects\, including Wordsworth’s friendship with the 
 mathematician William Rowan Hamilton\;  Andrei Markov’s random walk thr
 ough Eugene Onegin and the idea of mechanical language production\;  what
  geometry and poetry seem to look for in each other\;  and the vision of 
 geometry expressed in the poem by Rita Dove\, whence his talk title origin
 ates.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/distinguished-lecturer-ser

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211208T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMariano Sigman was born in Argentina and g
 rew up in Barcelona\, Spain. He obtained a master degree in physics at the
  University of Buenos Aires and a PhD in neuroscience in New York. He move
 d to Paris to investigate decision making\, cognitive architecture and con
 sciousness. In 2006 he founded the Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory\, a
 t the University of Buenos Aires\, an interdisciplinary group integrated 
 by physicists\, psychologists\, biologists\, engineers\, educational scien
 tists\, linguists\, mathematicians\, artists and computer scientists.\n\nH
 is lab has developed an empirical and theoretical approach to decision m
 aking\, with special focus on understanding the construction of confidence
  and subjective beliefs. Many aspects of his investigation rely on data m
 ining and computational tools on massive corpus of human behavior (text\, 
 decision making…). Recently\, he has progressively shifted his research 
 to understand how current knowledge of the brain and the mind may serve to
  improve educational practice. Many of the projects conduct are developed 
 at schools throughout the country and he is extending these investigations
  on cognitive development to hundreds of thousands of children through the
  One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) framework.\n\nThroughout his career he develo
 ped numerous research interactions with representatives of different domai
 ns of human culture including\, musicians\, professional chess players\, m
 athematicians\, magicians\, visual artists and chefs. Several of these int
 eractions resulted in exhibits presented in museums and galleries in Argen
 tina\, Mexico\, Brazil\, US\, Japan\, New York\, Austria.\n\nMariano is th
 e only Latin American scientist to be a director of the Human Brain Projec
 t\, was awarded a Human Frontiers Career Development Award\, the national 
 prize of physics\, the young investigator prize of “College de France”
 \, the IBM Scalable Data Analytics award and is a scholar of the James S. 
 McDonnell Foundation.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/distinguis

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T234500
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
