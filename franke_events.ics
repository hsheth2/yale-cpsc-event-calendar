SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  Alexander Paseau
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220928T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220928T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe look forward to continuing our Nature o
 f Inference colloquium series with a virtual talk by Alexander Paseau\, Pr
 ofessor of Mathematical Philosophy at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe tit
 le of Professor Paseau’s talk is Inference: A Logical-Philosophical Per
 spective.\n\nIn this talk\, Professor Paseau will describe some of his wor
 k on inference within mathematics and more generally. Inferences can be us
 efully divided into deductive or non-deductive. Formal logic studies deduc
 tive inference\, the obvious question here being: which formal logic corre
 ctly captures it? His view\, defended in his recent monograph\nOne True Lo
 gic\n(Oxford UP\, co-authored with Owen Griffiths)\, is that any such logi
 c must be highly infinite. In this Inference Project event\, he shall expl
 ain what this means and sketch some arguments for it.\n\nThe other side of
  the coin is non-deductive inference. This is much harder to capture preci
 sely\, but many interesting and important things can still be said about i
 t. Professor Paseau will present some of his ideas about non-deductive rea
 soning in mathematics and explain why\, contrary to current and traditiona
 l thinking\, it can be a source not just of justified belief but also know
 ledge.\n\nWhat links the two halves of the talk? The idea that inference\,
  both deductive and non-deductive\, is more permissive than often imagined
 .\n\nProfessor Gila Sher of the University of California\, San Diego will 
 be the conversant for this event.  She is a logician and professor of ph
 ilosophy who has worked extensively in the theory of truth and philoso
 phy of logic. Sher is a leading advocate of foundational holism\, a holis
 tic theory of epistemology.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nh

SUMMARY:Talk by Acclaimed Journalist Esther Honig
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20221116T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20221116T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us on Wednesday\, November 16 at 4 p.
 m. for a remarkable talk by journalist\nEsther Honig\n.\n\nIt was early sp
 ring\, nearly 15 years ago\, when Belen Delgado made the discovery of a li
 fetime. As a fisherman in rural Mexico\, Belen had a hunch that a giant ba
 nk of Callo de Hacha\, a rare and incredibly expensive shellfish\, lay jus
 t off the shore of his small coastal town. Together with friends\, he hire
 d a diver to plunge 70 feet below the surface and when he emerged the dive
 r confirmed Belen’s suspicion\, “wherever you step\,” he said\, “t
 here’s callo.” The colony of Callo de Hacha covered 30 miles of ocean 
 floor and was worth millions of dollars. This was the financial windfall t
 he town desperately needed\, but Belen wasn’t prepared for the chaos and
  greed that soon followed as his fellow fishermen succumbed to the “Whit
 e Gold Fever.” This story was produced for the podcast Snap Judgment in 
 partnership with FERN\, the Food and Environment Reporting Network. It exp
 lores overfishing\, climate change and the limitation of government regula
 tions when matched against the needs of people who are working to put food
  on the table.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zo
