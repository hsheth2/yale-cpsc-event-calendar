 9-information\n\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished herself in a career tha
 t has spanned advanced scientific research and the presidency of one of th
 e premier institutions of science and engineering in the world.\n\nAfter e
 arning a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester and a Ph.D. from
  Georgetown University at the School of Medicine\, carrying out her doctor
 al research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\, Dr. Hockfield wa
 s an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of California at San Franc
 isco\n. She then joined the scientific staff at the\nCold Spring Harbor La
 boratory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYale University\nin 1985\, 
 Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the development of the brain and on 
 glioma\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneered the use of monoc
 lonal antibody technology demonstrating that early experience results in l
 asting changes in the molecular structure of the brain.  She gained tenur
 e in 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilbert Professor of Neurobiol
 ogy\n.\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong\, innovative univers
 ity leader\, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences\, w
 ith oversight of more than 70 graduate programs\, and then as provost\, Ya
 le’s chief academic and administrative officer.\n\nFrom December 2004 th
 rough June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth president of MIT\,
  where she continues to hold a faculty appointment as professor of neurosc
 ience and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Researc
 h.\n\n\nUnder her leadership\, in 2006 MIT launched the\nMIT Energy Initi
 ative\n(\nMITEI)\n\, raising more than $350 million to accelerate researc
 h\, policy and education towards a sustainable energy future.  In recogni
 tion of MITEI’s momentum\, in October 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama d
 elivered a major energy address at MIT and visited its research laboratori
 es\, the first American President ever to do so.  In 2015\, she served as
  a member of a Congressional Commission evaluating the U.S. Department of 
 Energy laboratories.\n\n\n\nAs the first life scientist to lead MIT\, she 
 championed the breakthroughs emerging from the historic convergence of the
  life sciences with the engineering and physical sciences\, in fields from
  clean energy to cancer\, including the founding of MIT’s\nDavid H. Koc
 h Institute for Integrative Cancer Research\,\nthe\nInstitute for Medical 
 Engineering and Science\,\nand the\nRagon Institute of MGH\, MIT and Harva
 rd\n.  Dr. Hockfield’s book\,\nThe Age of Living Machines\n(2019)\, foc
 uses on this historic convergence of the life sciences and engineering –
  a story that holds the promise of overcoming some of the greatest humanit
 arian\, medical\, and environmental challenges of our time.\n\n\n\nLong an
  advocate for the research university as an engine of innovation and econo
 mic growth\, Dr. Hockfield also helped shape national policy on energy tec
 hnology and next-generation manufacturing.  In June 2011\, President Obam
 a appointed her co-chair of the steering committee of the\nAdvanced Manufa
 cturing Partnership\n\, a working coalition of academic\, government and i
 ndustry leaders.\n\n\n\nIn keeping with MIT’s entrepreneurial spirit and
  signature strength in working with industry\, she actively fostered the b
 urgeoning\nKendall Square innovation cluster\n\, populated by global giant
 s and startups in the emerging frontiers of biotech\, IT and energy\, with
  many tracing their roots to MIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield argued forcefully 
 for the value of MIT’s\nglobal engagement\n.  She actively expanded the
  Institute’s international education and research activities.  Building
  on the success of MIT OpenCourseWare in bringing high quality educationa
 l materials to learners the world over\, in early 2012\, Dr. Hockfield acc
 elerated the conversation around cost\, quality and access in higher educ
 ation with the launch of\nMITx\n.  This online learning initiative offer
 s a laboratory for experimenting with the use of new learning technologies
  and provides a portfolio of MIT courses to a virtual community of learn
 ers around the planet.  Further amplifying its impact\, in May 2012\, MI
 T joined forces with Harvard University to launch\nedX\n\, a partnership i
 n online education with the ambition to revolutionize learning on campus\
 , to offer first-rate teaching to learners around the globe\, and to open 
 unprecedented paths to learning about learning itself.\n\n\n\nInternationa
 l research collaborations also grew under Dr. Hockfield’s leadership\, t
 hrough new and expanded partnerships around the globe\, from Abu Dhabi to 
 Portugal\, and from Singapore to Colombia.  MIT partnered to found severa
 l wholly new institutions\, including the\nSingapore University of Techn
 ology and Design\nand the\nMasdar Institute of Science and Technology\n.\n
 \n\n\nDr. Hockfield was the first woman to lead MIT\, a development welco
 me at an Institute where nearly half the undergraduates are now women. A s
 ignature of her presidency was her vocal commitment to making MIT a leader
  in building diversity all along the pipeline of talent.  In November 200
 8\, she convened MIT’s first-ever Diversity Leadership Congress\, a gath
 ering of 300 leaders from across the Institute committed to cultivating a 
 culture of inclusion that allows everyone to contribute at the peak of the
 ir ability.  These efforts led to a marked increase in women and minority
  scholars joining the MIT faculty.\n\n\nBefore returning to MIT following 
 her presidency\, Dr. Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorshi
 p at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\, and the
  Carnegie Corporation/Vartan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowship at the Americ
 an Academy of Rome.  She is an elected member of the\nAmerican Academy of
  Arts and Sciences\nand an elected fellow of the\nAmerican Association for
  the Advancement of Science\n\, where she is the chairman.  She also serv
 es as a director of the\nCharles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\,\nCouncil on F
 oreign Relations\, Partners HealthCare System\,\nand the\nBelfer Center fo
 r Science and International Affairs\n\, and is a life member of the\nMIT C
 orporation\n.\nShe has served as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey with the 
 U.S. Department of State.\n\nDr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees from man
 y institutions\, including\nBrown University\, Duke University\, Georgetow
 n University\, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine\, Northeastern University\, Ts
 inghua University (Beijing)\, Université Pierre et Marie Curie\, Univers
 ity of Edinburgh\, University of Massachusetts Medical School\, University
  of Rochester\n\, and the\nWatson School of Biological Sciences at the Col
 d Spring Harbor Laboratory\n.  Her accomplishments have also been recogni
 zed by the Charles Judson Herrick Award from the American Association of A
 natomists\, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Award from the Yale University Graduat
 e School\, the Meliora Citation from the University of Rochester\, the Gol
 den Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement\, the Amelia Earhart Award
  from the Women’s Union\, the Edison Achievement Award\, the Pinnacle A
 ward for Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\
 , and the Geoffrey Beene Builders of Science Award from Research!America..
 \n\nDr. Hockfield lives in Cambridge with her husband\, Thomas N. Byrne\, 
 M.D.  They have an adult daughter\, Elizabeth.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogra
