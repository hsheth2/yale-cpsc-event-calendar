DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDetails on how to access this talk through
  Zoom will be released soon!\n\nBeyond the Historian’s Traditional Toolb
 ox: What Archeology\, Lidar\, and Chemical Residues can Teach us about the
  Year 1000\n\nThe traditional focus of historians on written documents oft
 en results in greater attention to literate societies\, but scientific bre
 akthroughs in recent years have underpinned multiple discoveries about soc
 ieties with little or no documentation. Some of the most exciting discover
 ies concern the voyages of the Malayo-Polynesians from the Malay peninsula
  to Madagascar\, Hawaii\, Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\, and New Zealand\, the
  extent of Angkor Wat\, and the opening of overland routes across the Amer
 icas. This talk will introduce some of the new technologies discussed in H
 ansen’s book\,\nThe Year 1000: When Explorers Connected the World—and 
 Globalization Began\n(April 2020\, Scribner).\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.y

SUMMARY:Pathways to a Sustainable Future - On-line Talk
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20201015T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nSustainability has emerged as a global pri
 ority over the past several years with important commitments made through 
 the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the UN’s Sustainable Deve
 lopment Goals. But political divides\, regional disputes\, and deep disagr
 eements over core principles have made it nearly impossible to chart a cou
 rse toward a sustainable future. This talk will highlight fresh thinking o
 n sustainability from a new book that emerged from a multi-year initiative
  from the Yale School of the Environment that engaged a diverse set of env
 ironmental thought leaders from diverse disciplines and across the politic
 al spectrum. The book’s 40 essays cover such subjects as innovation\, co
 mmunications\, environmental justice\, Big Data\, public health\, and clim
 ate change — all with an emphasis on identifying pathways to a sustainab
 ility future.\n\nDan Esty is the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law 
 and Policy at Yale’s School of the Environment and Yale Law School. He s
 erved as head of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Pr
 otection from 2011 to 2014 and in several leadership roles at the U.S. Env
 ironmental Protection Agency from 1989 to 1993.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram
