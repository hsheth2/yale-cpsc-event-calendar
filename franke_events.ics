DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Lyanda Lynn Haupt\, Author of

DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDetails to follow soon.  More on the subj
 ect of Lyanda’s book and talk topic follows:\n\n“The story of the comp
 oser and his pet bird led me on an unexpected journey to Vienna and Salzbu
 rg. It led me into the workings of the symphony\, the opera\, ornithologic
 al labs\, the depths of music theory\, the field of linguistics\, and the 
 nature of creative inspiration. It led me to the crazy experience of raisi
 ng a starling in my own home. It led me deep into the spirit of the natura
 l world and our constant wild animal companions.\nIt led me to the underst
 anding that there is more possibility in our relationships with animals—
 with all the creatures of the earth\, not just the traditionally beautiful
 \, or endangered\, or loved—than I had ever imagined.”\n\nRegister in
