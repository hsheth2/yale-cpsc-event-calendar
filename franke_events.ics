DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us on ZOOM on Wednesday\, November 16
  at 4 p.m. for a remarkable talk by journalist\nEsther Honig\n.\n\nIt was 
 early spring\, nearly 15 years ago\, when Belén Delgado made the discover
 y of a lifetime. As a fisherman in rural Mexico\, Belén had a hunch that 
 a giant bank of Callo de Hacha\, a rare and incredibly expensive shellfish
 \, lay just off the shore of his small coastal town. Together with friends
 \, he hired a diver to plunge 70 feet below the surface\, and when he emer
 ged\, the diver confirmed Belén’s suspicion.  “Wherever you step\,
 ” he said\, “there’s callo.” The colony of Callo de Hacha covered 
 30 miles of ocean floor and was worth millions of dollars. This was the fi
 nancial windfall the town desperately needed\, but Belén wasn’t prepare
 d for the chaos and greed that soon followed as his fellow fishermen succu
 mbed to the “White Gold Fever.”\n\nRegister in advance for this webina
