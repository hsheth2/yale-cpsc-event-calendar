SUMMARY:Inference Project Virtual Talk:  Causality at the Intersection of 
 Simulation\, Inference\, Science\, and Learning
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211215T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211215T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe sciences are replete with high-fidelit
 y simulators: computational manifestations of causal\, mechanistic models.
  Ironically\, while these simulators provide our highest-fidelity physical
  models\, they are not well suited for inferring properties of the model f
 rom data. In this talk\, Professor Kyle Cranmer of the Department of Physi
 cs of New York University will describe the emerging area of simulation-ba
 sed inference and describe how machine learning is being brought to bear o
 n these challenging problems. It is then tempting to imagine the path towa
 rds developing an autonomous AI scientist also responsible for designing e
 xperiments and hypothesis generation. Interestingly\, this framing brings 
 a new perspective on the role of causality and agency that incorporates re
 cent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe mode
 rated post-talk conversation will take place on Monday\, December 20 at 4 
 p.m.\, and the conversant will soon be confirmed.\n\nRegister in advance f

SUMMARY:Franke Undergraduate Fellowship Grants for 2021/2022
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T224500
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T234500
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
