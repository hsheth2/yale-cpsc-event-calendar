SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Conversation:  “Causal Inference in C
 omplex Non-linear Systems:  A Cautionary Tale”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210617T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210617T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nNon-linear phenomena like climate systems 
 and epidemics display rich patterns of behavior across various temporal a
 nd spatial scales.   These rich patterns often produce\, in students of 
 these phenomena\, the temptation to attribute to them underlying causes. 
   Professor Winsberg will review examples of this from the fields of clim
 ate change and epidemiology\, by experts and lay people alike.   But cau
 sal inference in these contexts is especially epistemically perilous.  
  He will discuss\, in particular\, a method of causal attribution that ha
 s been especially popular during the COVID-19 epidemic:  the method of sy
 nthetic controls\, and he will explain why\, despite appearances to the co
 ntrary\, it is not a magic bullet for overcoming these problems.\n\nEric W
 insberg is Professor of Philosophy at the University of South Florida.  
  He works in the philosophy of science\, especially in philosophy of clima
 te science and philosophy of physics.  He is especially interested in the
  role of models and simulations in the sciences.   He is the author of\n
 Science in the Age of Computer Simulation\nfrom the University of Chicago 
 Press and\nPhilosophy and Climate Science\nfrom Cambridge University Press
 \, as well the forthcoming\nCambridge Elements in Philosophy of Science\no
 n Models in Science.  Over the last several months\, he has focused on th
 e use of models and methods of causal inference in the COVID-19 pandemic.\
