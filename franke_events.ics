DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“Bias in Algorithms”\n\nArtificial alg
 orithms are increasingly being deployed to inform\, endorse\, and govern v
 arious aspects of today’s society. Their reach includes the domains of h
 iring\, lending\, medicine\, criminal justice\, insurance\, allocation of 
 public services\, social and business interactions\, and the dissemination
  of information and news.  Through a synthesis of computational and stati
 stical models for representing concepts\, human-generated datasets that pr
 ovide examples for training\, and powerful optimization algorithms that ca
 n efficiently navigate through vast and complex landscapes to infer conce
 pts that explain data\, such algorithms have taken big strides towards mim
 icking various aspects of natural intelligence.\n\nThese algorithms have l
 ed to tremendous economic and social impact but have also been shown to be
  biased – they can discriminate\, reinforce prejudices\, polarize opin
 ions\, and influence political processes.  How can subjective human or so
 cietal biases emerge in the objective world of artificial algorithms?  An
 d how can we design algorithms free from these limitations?\n\nThe search 
 for answers to these questions also leads us to some understanding of the 
 bias in human decision-making algorithms.\n\nRegister in advance for this

SUMMARY:Inference Project:  Post-Talk Conversation with Professor Nisheeth
  Vishnoi
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211122T220000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211122T230000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nProfessor Aleksander\nMądry will lead the
  post-talk discussion for the Inference Project talk by Professor Nisheeth
  Vishnoi on Monday\, November 22.  He is the Cadence Design Systems Prof
 essor of Computing in the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Scien
 ce Department and a member of the Computer Science and Artifical Intellig
 ence Lab at MIT.  He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 2011 and prior to 
 joining the university’s faculty\, he spent a year as a postdoctoral res
 earcher at Microsoft Research New England.  He also was on the faculty o
 f\nEPFL\nuntil early 2015.  Professor Mądry is currently serving as the
  Director of the MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning and is the 
 Faculty Lead of the CSAIL-MSR Trustworthy and Robust AI Collaboration.  
 His research spans machine learning\, optimization\, and algorithmic grap
 h theory\, and he has a strong interest in building on the existing machin
 e learning techniques to forge a decision-making toolkit that is reliable 
 and well-understood enough to be safely and responsibly deployed in the re
 al world.\n\nRegister\nin advance for this webinar and the post-talk conve

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Mariano Sigman
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211208T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20211208T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMariano Sigman is one of the most outstand
 ing neuroscientists in the world\, with over 150 publications in the most 
 prestigious scientific journals. He is also passionate about experimentati
 on and has worked with magicians\, chess masters\, musicians\, athletes an
 d visual artists to bring his knowledge of neuroscience to different aspec
 ts of human culture and apply it in different contexts. He has participate
 d twice (2016 and 2017) in the TED global events in Vancouver\, the second
  with Dan Ariely. In his conferences\, he teaches how the mind works and w
 hat lessons we can learn about decision making\, leadership\, team managem
 ent\, personal development or creative skills\, his presentations always w
 ith a high level of participation from the audience through experiments an
 d games.\n\nHe obtained his degree in Physics from the University of Bueno
 s Aires\, PhD in Neuroscience (PhD) in New York and did a post-Doctorate i
 n Cognitive Sciences at the College de France (Paris). In 2016\, he was aw
 arded the Pio XI Medal\, from the Pontifical Academy of Science\, one of t
 he most outstanding prizes of science (shared among others with Stephen Ha
 wking\, and several Nobel prize winners).\n\nBeyond academy\, Mariano Sigm
 an’s research has had practical implications in Medicine (for example in
  the diagnosis of vegetative or autistic patients)\, in Education (with ef
 fective interventions to improve decision-making and learning in schools t
 hroughout Latin America) and in Art (in a project “The morphology of the
  look” that has been exhibited in New York\, Austria\, Moscow\, Mexico\,
  Japan… and was presented in 2017 at the Venice Biennale). He has also d
 eveloped an extensive career in the proliferation of science that includes
  TV programmes and hundreds of articles published in different editorial m
 edia. He is also the author of the bestseller\nThe Secret Life of the Mind

SUMMARY:Franke Undergraduate Fellowship Grants for 2021/2022
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T224500
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T234500
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
