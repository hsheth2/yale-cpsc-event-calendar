SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  Brian Cantwell Smith
DTSTART:20221207T200000
DTEND:20221207T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nOur December 2022 Understanding the Nature
  of Inference colloquium talk will be given by Brian Cantwell Smith\, the 
 Reid Hoffman Professor of Artificial Intelligence and the Human at the Uni
 versity of Toronto.  The title of this talk and subsequent discussion is 
 “Inference in a Non-Conceptual World.”\n\nClassical models of inferenc
 e\, such as those based on logic\, take inference to be *conceptual* – i
 .e.\, to involve representations formed of terms\, predicates\, relation s
 ymbols\, and the like.  Conceptual representation of this sort is assumed
  to reflect the structure of the world: objects of various types\, exempli
 fying properties\, standing in relations\, grouped together in sets\, etc.
   These paired roughly algebraic assumptions (one epistemic\, the other o
 ntological) form the basis of classical logic and traditional AI (GOFAI).\
 n\nIn this talk\, Professor Brian Cantwell Smith will argue that the world
  itself is not conceptual\, in the sense of not consisting (at least au fo
 nd) of objects\, properties\, relations\, etc.  That is\, he will argue a
 gainst the ontological assumption.  Rather\, he believes that taking the 
 world to consist of the familiar ontological furniture of objects\, proper
 ties\, etc. results from epistemic processes of abstraction and idealizati
 on.  Denser representations with so-called “nonconceptual content” ca
 n be closer to what is known as “ground truth”.  Deep learning models
  and other developments in contemporary AI can therefore be understood as 
 initial steps to understand inference over surpassingly rich fields of und
 iscretized features.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://y
