SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  Professor Jenann Ismael
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210924T070000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210924T080000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThere has been an enormous burgeoning of i
 nterest in causation across the science. One can open up a journal in micr
 obiology and be assailed with detailed models of  the causal structure of
  cells and proteins. One can find textbooks on the increasing array comput
 ational tools for causal search and discovery\,and take classes devoted to
  formal methods in causal modeling. Psychologists are unraveling new detai
 ls about how people use causal concepts in reasoning. While details of the
 se kinds are in abundant supply\, it remains a contested question what cau
 sation is and how it fits into a physics-based ontology. In this talk\, Pr
 ofessor Ismael is going to assemble the pieces of emerging scientific unde
 rstanding of causation into an account of where (and  how) causation aris
 es in the architecture of the cosmos\, with special attention to the conte
 sted questions of where the direction of causation comes from and its rela
 tionship agency.\n\nProfessor Jenann Ismael joined the faculty at Columbia
  University in 2018.  Most of her work falls into two classes. The first
  class circumscribes central concerns of the philosophy of physics. Intere
 sts there include the structure of space and time\, the foundations of qua
 ntum mechanics\, the role of simplicity and symmetry in physics\, question
 s about the nature of probability\, natural laws and causal relations. The
  second class includes mind\, cognition\, phenomenology\, and the nature o
 f perspective.\n\n\nProfessor Ismael received her Ph.D. from Princeton Uni
 versity\, was a Mellon Fellow at Stanford\, and taught at the University o
 f Arizona before coming to Columbia.  She has held a number of prestigiou
 s fellowships\, including an NEH fellowship at the National Humanities Cen
 ter\, a Queen Elizabeth II Research Fellowship from the Australian Researc
 h Council\, and fellowships from the Templeton Foundation and CASBS (Cente
 r for Advanced Studies in Behavioral Science at Stanford).\n\n\n\nJames Wo
 odward\, Distinguished Professor in the Department of the History and Phil
 osophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh\, will moderate a post-t
 alk conversation with Professor Ismael on September 25.  Before coming t
 o Pittsburgh in the fall of 2010\, Professor Woodward was J.O. and Juliett
 e Koepfli Professor of Humanities at the California Institute of Technolog
 y.  His research covers a number of different areas\, including theories 
 of causation\, explanation and inductive inference in general philosophy o
 f science\, philosophy of psychology\, and philosophy of social science. 
  His interests in psychology include the empirical psychology of causal le
 arning and judgment\; in this connection he is a participant in a multidis
 ciplinary collaboration sponsored by the McDonnell foundation that explore
 s the relation between formal theories of causal inference and the inferen
 ces adults and children actually make.  Professor Woodward also maintains
  an interest in moral psychology and the empirical study of human behavior
  in morally significant situations.\n\n\n\nZoom details and conversant inf

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
