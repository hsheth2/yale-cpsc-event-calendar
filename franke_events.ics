DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDetails on how to access this talk through
  Zoom will be released soon!\n\nBeyond the Historian’s Traditional Toolb
 ox: What Archeology\, Lidar\, and Chemical Residues can Teach us about the
  Year 1000\n\nThe traditional focus of historians on written documents oft
 en results in greater attention to literate societies\, but scientific bre
 akthroughs in recent years have underpinned multiple discoveries about soc
 ieties with little or no documentation. Some of the most exciting discover
 ies concern the voyages of the Malayo-Polynesians from the Malay peninsula
  to Madagascar\, Hawaii\, Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\, and New Zealand\, the
  extent of Angkor Wat\, and the opening of overland routes across the Amer
 icas. This talk will introduce some of the new technologies discussed in H
 ansen’s book\,\nThe Year 1000: When Explorers Connected the World—and 
 Globalization Began\n(April 2020\, Scribner).\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.y
