SUMMARY:Distinguished Lecturer Series\, Talk by Susan Hockfield
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200413T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200413T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished herself 
 in a career that has spanned advanced scientific research and the presiden
 cy of one of the premier institutions of science and engineering in the wo
 rld.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester a
 nd a Ph.D. from Georgetown University at the School of Medicine\, carrying
  out her doctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\, D
 r. Hockfield was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of Californ
 ia at San Francisco\n. She then joined the scientific staff at the\nCold S
 pring Harbor Laboratory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYale Univers
 ity\nin 1985\, Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the development of th
 e brain and on glioma\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneered t
 he use of monoclonal antibody technology demonstrating that early experien
 ce results in lasting changes in the molecular structure of the brain.  S
 he gained tenure in 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilbert Profess
 or of Neurobiology\n.\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong\, inn
 ovative university leader\, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts a
 nd Sciences\, with oversight of more than 70 graduate programs\, and then 
 as provost\, Yale’s chief academic and administrative officer.\n\nFrom D
 ecember 2004 through June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth pre
 sident of MIT\, where she continues to hold a faculty appointment as profe
 ssor of neuroscience and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative
  Cancer Research.\n\n\nUnder her leadership\, in 2006 MIT launched the\nM
 IT Energy Initiative\n(\nMITEI)\n\, raising more than $350 million to acc
 elerate research\, policy and education towards a sustainable energy futur
 e.  In recognition of MITEI’s momentum\, in October 2009 U.S. President
  Barack Obama delivered a major energy address at MIT and visited its rese
 arch laboratories\, the first American President ever to do so.  In 2015\
 , she served as a member of a Congressional Commission evaluating the U.S.
  Department of Energy laboratories.\n\n\n\nAs the first life scientist to 
 lead MIT\, she championed the breakthroughs emerging from the historic con
 vergence of the life sciences with the engineering and physical sciences\,
  in fields from clean energy to cancer\, including the founding of MIT’
 s\nDavid H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research\,\nthe\nInstitu
 te for Medical Engineering and Science\,\nand the\nRagon Institute of MGH\
 , MIT and Harvard\n.  Dr. Hockfield’s book\,\nThe Age of Living Machine
 s\n(2019)\, focuses on this historic convergence of the life sciences and 
 engineering – a story that holds the promise of overcoming some of the g
 reatest humanitarian\, medical\, and environmental challenges of our time.
 \n\n\n\nLong an advocate for the research university as an engine of innov
 ation and economic growth\, Dr. Hockfield also helped shape national polic
 y on energy technology and next-generation manufacturing.  In June 2011\,
  President Obama appointed her co-chair of the steering committee of the\n
 Advanced Manufacturing Partnership\n\, a working coalition of academic\, g
 overnment and industry leaders.\n\n\n\nIn keeping with MIT’s entrepreneu
 rial spirit and signature strength in working with industry\, she actively
  fostered the burgeoning\nKendall Square innovation cluster\n\, populated 
 by global giants and startups in the emerging frontiers of biotech\, IT an
 d energy\, with many tracing their roots to MIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield arg
 ued forcefully for the value of MIT’s\nglobal engagement\n.  She active
 ly expanded the Institute’s international education and research activit
 ies.  Building on the success of MIT OpenCourseWare in bringing high qua
 lity educational materials to learners the world over\, in early 2012\, Dr
 . Hockfield accelerated the conversation around cost\, quality and access
  in higher education with the launch of\nMITx\n.  This online learning in
 itiative offers a laboratory for experimenting with the use of new learni
 ng technologies and provides a portfolio of MIT courses to a virtual com
 munity of learners around the planet.  Further amplifying its impact\, i
 n May 2012\, MIT joined forces with Harvard University to launch\nedX\n\, 
 a partnership in online education with the ambition to revolutionize lear
 ning on campus\, to offer first-rate teaching to learners around the globe
 \, and to open unprecedented paths to learning about learning itself.\n\n\
 n\nInternational research collaborations also grew under Dr. Hockfield’s
  leadership\, through new and expanded partnerships around the globe\, fro
 m Abu Dhabi to Portugal\, and from Singapore to Colombia.  MIT partnered 
 to found several wholly new institutions\, including the\nSingapore Univ
 ersity of Technology and Design\nand the\nMasdar Institute of Science and 
 Technology\n.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield was the first woman to lead MIT\, a de
 velopment welcome at an Institute where nearly half the undergraduates are
  now women. A signature of her presidency was her vocal commitment to maki
 ng MIT a leader in building diversity all along the pipeline of talent.  
 In November 2008\, she convened MIT’s first-ever Diversity Leadership Co
 ngress\, a gathering of 300 leaders from across the Institute committed to
  cultivating a culture of inclusion that allows everyone to contribute at 
 the peak of their ability.  These efforts led to a marked increase in wom
 en and minority scholars joining the MIT faculty.\n\n\nBefore returning to
  MIT following her presidency\, Dr. Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiti
 ng Professorship at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Gover
 nment\, and the Carnegie Corporation/Vartan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowshi
 p at the American Academy of Rome.  She is an elected member of the\nAmer
 ican Academy of Arts and Sciences\nand an elected fellow of the\nAmerican 
 Association for the Advancement of Science\n\, where she is the chairman. 
  She also serves as a director of the\nCharles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\
 ,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\, Partners HealthCare System\,\nand the\nB
 elfer Center for Science and International Affairs\n\, and is a life membe
 r of the\nMIT Corporation\n.\nShe has served as a U.S. Science Envoy to T
 urkey with the U.S. Department of State.\n\nDr. Hockfield holds honorary d
 egrees from many institutions\, including\nBrown University\, Duke Univers
 ity\, Georgetown University\, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine\, Northeastern 
 University\, Tsinghua University (Beijing)\, Université Pierre et Marie C
 urie\, University of Edinburgh\, University of Massachusetts Medical Scho
 ol\, University of Rochester\n\, and the\nWatson School of Biological Scie
 nces at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\n.  Her accomplishments have al
 so been recognized by the Charles Judson Herrick Award from the American A
 ssociation of Anatomists\, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Award from the Yale Uni
 versity Graduate School\, the Meliora Citation from the University of Roch
 ester\, the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement\, the Ameli
 a Earhart Award from the Women’s Union\, the Edison Achievement Award\,
  the Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Cham
 ber of Commerce\, and the Geoffrey Beene Builders of Science Award from Re
 search!America..\n\nDr. Hockfield lives in Cambridge with her husband\, Th
 omas N. Byrne\, M.D.  They have an adult daughter\, Elizabeth.\n\n\nhttp
