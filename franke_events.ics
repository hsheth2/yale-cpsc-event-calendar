DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe
 l.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your exciting ideas!\n\n\nhttps://frankep

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk\, “How Humans and Matter Trans
 formed One Another”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210420T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210420T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nOften when we discuss the development of c
 hemicals and substances\, the conversation usually focuses on how scientis
 ts and inventors synthesized them. In this talk\, materials scientist and 
 science writer Ainissa Ramirez will highlight how simple materials and the
  inventions they enabled shaped society.  Based on her new book\nThe Alch
 emy of Us\n\, she will show how everyday inventions had a hand in fashioni
 ng language\, politics\, and even our bodies.\n\nAinissa Ramirez\, Ph.D. i
 s an award-winning scientist and science communicator\, who is passionate 
 about getting the general public excited about science. A graduate of Brow
 n University\, she earned her doctorate in materials science and engineeri
 ng from Stanford. Dr. Ramirez started her career as a scientist at Bell La
 boratories in Murray Hill\, New Jersey\, and later worked as an associate 
 professor of mechanical engineering at Yale. She authored the books\nThe A
 lchemy of Us\nand\nSave Our Science\,\nand co-authored\nNewton’s\n\nFoot
 ball\n. She has written for\nForbes\n\,\nTime\, The Atlantic\, Scientific 
 American\, American Scientist\,\nand\nScience\nand has explained science h
 eadlines on CBS\, CNN\, NPR\, ESPN\, and PBS.\n\nRamirez speaks widely on 
 the topics of science and technology and gave a TED talk on the importance
  of science education. She has been awarded prizes from the National Scien
 ce Foundation\, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation\, Massachusetts Institute o
 f Technology\, and the American Institute of Physics. She speaks internati
 onally on the importance of making science fun and has served as a science
  advisor to the American Film Institute\, WGBH/NOVA\, the American Associa
 tion for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and several science museums. Sh
 e also hosts a science podcast called\nScience Underground\n.\n\nRegister

 Professor Elisa Celis:\n\nProfessor Elisa Celis is an assistant professor 
 in the Statistics & Data Science department at Yale University.  She stud
 ies the manifestation of social and economic biases in our online lives vi
 a the algorithms that encode and perpetuate them.  Her work spans multipl
 e disciplines including data science\, machine learning\, and theoretical 
 computer science with an emphasis on fairness and diversity in artificial 
 intelligence and machine learning.  Professor Celis’ research focuses o
 n problems that arise at the interface of computation and machine learning
  and its societal and economic ramifications. She approaches these problem
 s by using both experimental and theoretical techniques.  Her work spans 
 multiple areas including social computing and crowdsourcing\, data science
 \, and algorithm design with an emphasis on fairness and diversity in arti
 ficial intelligence and machine learning.  Her recent works include metho
 dologies for debiasing data\, approaches to produce diverse ranking and re
 commendation systems\, mechanisms to avoid discrimination in access to opp
 ortunity in online advertisements\, and the design of voting techniques th
 at allow for the election of diverse committees.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogra

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  “Are Scientific Models F
 ictions?  Model-Based Science as Epistemic Warfare”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210422T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210422T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nIn the current epistemological debate\, sc
 ientific models are not only considered as useful devices for explaining f
 acts or discovering new entities\, laws\, and theories\, but also rubricat
 ed under various new labels: from the classical ones\, as abstract entitie
 s and idealizations\, to the more recent\, as fictions\, surrogates\, cred
 ible worlds\, missing systems\, make-believe\, parables\, functional\, epi
 stemic actions\, revealing capacities. Professor Magnani of the University
  of Pavia in Italy will discuss these approaches showing some of their epi
 stemological inadequacies\, also taking advantage of recent results in cog
 nitive science. The main aim is to revise and criticize fictionalism\, als
 o reframing the received idea of abstractness and ideality of models with 
 the help of recent results coming from the area of distributed cognition (
 common coding) and abductive cognition (manipulative).  Professor Magnani
  will illustrate how scientific modeling activity can be better described 
 taking advantage of the concept of “epistemic warfare\,” which sees sc
 ientific enterprise as a complicated struggle for rational knowledge in wh
 ich it is crucial to distinguish epistemic (for example scientific models)
  from non-epistemic (for example fictions\, falsities\, propaganda) weapon
 s. Finally\, he will contend that it is misleading to analyze models in sc
 ience by adopting a confounding mixture of static and dynamic aspects of t
 he scientific enterprise. Scientific models in a static perspective (for e
 xample when inserted in a textbook) certainly appear fictional to the epis
 temologist\, but their fictional character disappears in case a dynamic pe
 rspective is adopted. A reference to the originative role of thought exper
 iment in Galileo’s discoveries and to the usefulness of Feyerabend’s c
 ounterinduction in criticizing the role of resemblance in model-based cogn
 ition is also provided\, to further enrich the answer to the question indi
 cated by the title of this talk.\n\nProfessor Jim Weatherall of UC Irvine 
 will lead a conversation with Professor Magnani the next day at 3 p.m.\n\n

  Mozart’s Starling
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMozart’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Lang
 uage\, and the Human Relationship with the Natural World\n\nThe story soun
 ds apocryphal\, but it’s actually true.  In the spring of 1784\, Mozart
  found a starling in a Viennese shop mimicking the motif from one of his o
 wn concertos\, and he took the bird home as a pet.  How did it come to pa
 ss that the sublime classical composer found inspiration in one of the wor
 ld’s most ecologically despised species?  The answer leads to a beautif
 ul tangle of music theory\, linguistics\, the nature of creative inspirati
 on\, and the human relationship with the wild earth.\n\nRegister in advanc
