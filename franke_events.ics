DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities at Yale\n\nFranke Interdisciplinary Research Awards for Graduate St
 udents\n\nAcademic specialization increasingly leads to isolation among sc
 holars and the disciplines they study\, resulting in misunderstanding and 
 the erosion of common intellectual goals.  We hold that this isolation is
  also a barrier to research progress on interdisciplinary questions situat
 ed between traditional areas of study.  The Franke Program in Science and
  the Humanities is founded on the twin convictions that the fundamental qu
 estions that engage humanists must be informed by basic insights of scienc
 e and that meaningful scientific inquiry in turn deepens with humanistic k
 nowledge. The Franke Program in Science and the Humanities at Yale is exci
 ted to announce the Franke Interdisciplinary Research Awards for graduate 
 students.  This summer\, the Program plans to select up to five interdisc
 iplinary research projects to receive funding of $2\,000 each to be held d
 uring the academic year 2021 – 2022.  We welcome proposals that advance
  our mission of fostering communication\, mutual understanding\, collabora
 tive research\, and teaching among diverse scientific and humanistic disci
 plines.  Research proposals are required to have two faculty members from
  different departments/disciplines as intellectual mentors.  Letters of r
 ecommendation will be requested from these faculty mentors for short-liste
 d candidates.  Awardees are required to attend two dinners\, which at thi
 s point we expect will be virtual\, in fall 2021 and spring 2022 and prese
 nt their projects.  Previous awardees and projects including the followin

SUMMARY:Competition Now Open for Franke Postdoctoral Research Award
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210828T010000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210828T020000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities at Yale is excited to announce a new year of the Franke Postdoctora
 l Research Award.  In September 2021\, the Program will select a few inte
 rdisciplinary research projects to receive funding of $3K each.  Preferen
 ce will be given to scholars whose areas of research and methods advance o
 ur mission of fostering communication\, mutual understanding\, collaborati
 ve research\, and teaching among diverse scientific and humanistic discipl
 ines.  Funding should be used to develop an interdisciplinary aspect of a
  fellow’s current research program.  Awards are made upon evaluation of
  the submitted proposals by a selection committee that includes the Direct
 or of the Program and members of the Franke Program Advisory Board (\nhttp
 s://frankeprogram.yale.edu/people\n).  Please complete and submit this pa
 ge electronically to the Program’s Assistant Director\, Ty Kamp (\nty.ka
 mp@yale.edu\n)\, along with your project proposal by August 27\, 2021.  F
 ellows should be prepared to present their projects in a virtual gathering
  this fall.\n\nAcademic specialization increasingly leads to isolation amo
 ng scholars and the disciplines they study\, resulting in misunderstanding
  and the erosion of common intellectual goals.  We hold that this isolati
 on is also a barrier to research progress on interdisciplinary questions s
 ituated between traditional areas of study.  The Franke Program in Scienc
 e and the Humanities is founded on the twin convictions that the fundament
 al questions that engage humanists must be informed by basic insights of s
 cience and that meaningful scientific inquiry depends on humanistic knowle
 dge.  Our goal is to build an intellectual community of scholars who thin
 k in a pan-disciplinary manner as we believe that this mind-set generates 
 original\, creative and innovative breakthroughs.  The Franke Program spo
 nsors lectures\, colloquia\, conferences\, undergraduate courses\, faculty
  seminars\, and performances\, as well as independent research projects de
 vised by undergraduate and graduate students.  Once selected\, awardees a
 re expected to attend a dinner conversation and presentation once a semest
 er with the entire cohort of Franke undergraduate and graduate research fe
 llows.  Upon completion of the work\, a detailed summary of the project a
 nd outcomes is to be submitted to the Program.  Note that all funded proj
 ects must cite the support of The Franke Program in Science and the Humani
 ties in all advertising materials and products.\n\nPlease submit\nthis doc

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  The Inference of Nature: C
 ause and Effect in Molecular Biology
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210830T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210830T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nTheoretical approaches have always played 
 an important role in biology\, dating back to Mendel’s peas. In today’
 s era of genomics and big data in biology\, statistical and computational
  tools are even more vital for biologists seeking to infer causation in li
 ving systems. To illustrate the range of methods\, from modelling to machi
 ne learning\, and how they contribute to understanding biological mechanis
 ms\, I will pick examples from some of the core problems my lab has been i
 nvestigating as case studies. Starting with the assembly of proteins into 
 complexes\, I will move on to the single cell revolution in genomics and o
 ur quest to develop cell atlases of the human body. I will finish with our
  work leveraging these atlases to understand how COVID-19 affects the body
 . The examples will show how intertwined and complementary ‘wet’ (i.e.
  experimental) and ‘dry’ (i.e. computational/theoretical) approaches a
 re in today’s biology.\n\nThe conversant for the August 31\, 2021 discus
 sion will be\nNeil Lawrence\n\, the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machin
 e Learning at the University of Cambridge.  He has been working on machin
 e learning models for over 20 years.  He recently returned to academia af
 ter three years as Director of Machine Learning at Amazon.  Professor Law
 rence’s main interest is the interaction of machine learning with the ph
 ysical world.  This interest was triggered by deploying machine learning 
 in the African context\, where ‘end-to-end’ solutions are normally req
 uired.  This has inspired new research directions at the interface of mac
 hine learning and systems research\, this work is funded by a Senior AI Fe
 llowship from the Alan Turing Institute.  Professor Lawrence is also visi
 ting Professor at the University of Sheffield and the co-host of Talking M
 achines.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/inference-project-talk-
