 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Susan Hockfield
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210301T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210301T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“The Age of Living Machines:  How Biolo
 gy Will Build the Next Technology Revolution”\n\nWith an anticipated wor
 ld population of over 9.5 billion by 2050\, we face an unprecedented chall
 enge to sustainably provide sufficient food\, water\, energy and healthcar
 e.  Convergence\, the merging of previously distinct disciplines\, has em
 erged as a powerful model with untold potential to drive a new cycle of i
 nnovation-based economic growth.  Bringing together insights and discove
 ries from the life\, engineering\, computation and physical sciences holds
  the promise of accelerating discovery and the development of new technolo
 gies to meet the 21st century’s needs.  Promoting convergence approache
 s in education and research can pave the way to the discoveries and techno
 logies that will transform our world.\n\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished
  herself in a career that has spanned advanced scientific research and the
  presidency of one of the premier institutions of science and engineering 
 in the world.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. in biology from the University of Ro
 chester and a Ph.D. from Georgetown University at the School of Medicine\,
  carrying out her doctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (
 NIH)\, Dr. Hockfield was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of
  California at San Francisco\n. She then joined the scientific staff at th
 e\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYal
 e University\nin 1985\, Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the developm
 ent of the brain and on glioma\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pi
 oneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology demonstrating that early
  experience results in lasting changes in the molecular structure of the b
 rain.  She gained tenure in 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilber
 t Professor of Neurobiology\n.\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a str
 ong\, innovative university leader\, first as dean of its Graduate School 
 of Arts and Sciences\, with oversight of more than 70 graduate programs\, 
 and then as provost\, Yale’s chief academic and administrative officer.\
 n\nFrom December 2004 through June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixt
 eenth president of MIT\, where she continues to hold a faculty appointment
  as professor of neuroscience and as a member of the Koch Institute for In
 tegrative Cancer Research.\n\nRegister in advance for this meeting:\n\nhtt
 ps://yale.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAqfuytpzwoG9Engg8fbriHVzaSqiFhX0IH\n\
 n\n\nUnder her leadership\, in 2006 MIT launched the\nMIT Energy Initiati
 ve\n(\nMITEI)\n\, raising more than $350 million to accelerate research\,
  policy and education towards a sustainable energy future.  In recognitio
 n of MITEI’s momentum\, in October 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama deli
 vered a major energy address at MIT and visited its research laboratories\
 , the first American President ever to do so.  In 2015\, she served as a 
 member of a Congressional Commission evaluating the U.S. Department of Ene
 rgy laboratories.\n\n\n\nAs the first life scientist to lead MIT\, she cha
 mpioned the breakthroughs emerging from the historic convergence of the li
 fe sciences with the engineering and physical sciences\, in fields from cl
 ean energy to cancer\, including the founding of MIT’s\nDavid H. Koch I
 nstitute for Integrative Cancer Research\,\nthe\nInstitute for Medical Eng
 ineering and Science\,\nand the\nRagon Institute of MGH\, MIT and Harvard\
 n.  Dr. Hockfield’s book\,\nThe Age of Living Machines\n(2019)\, focuse
 s on this historic convergence of the life sciences and engineering – a 
 story that holds the promise of overcoming some of the greatest humanitari
 an\, medical\, and environmental challenges of our time.\n\n\n\nLong an ad
 vocate for the research university as an engine of innovation and economic
  growth\, Dr. Hockfield also helped shape national policy on energy techno
 logy and next-generation manufacturing.  In June 2011\, President Obama a
 ppointed her co-chair of the steering committee of the\nAdvanced Manufactu
 ring Partnership\n\, a working coalition of academic\, government and indu
 stry leaders.\n\n\n\nIn keeping with MIT’s entrepreneurial spirit and si
 gnature strength in working with industry\, she actively fostered the burg
 eoning\nKendall Square innovation cluster\n\, populated by global giants a
 nd startups in the emerging frontiers of biotech\, IT and energy\, with ma
 ny tracing their roots to MIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield argued forcefully for
  the value of MIT’s\nglobal engagement\n.  She actively expanded the In
 stitute’s international education and research activities.  Building on
  the success of MIT OpenCourseWare in bringing high quality educational m
 aterials to learners the world over\, in early 2012\, Dr. Hockfield accele
 rated the conversation around cost\, quality and access in higher educati
 on with the launch of\nMITx\n.  This online learning initiative offers a
  laboratory for experimenting with the use of new learning technologies an
 d provides a portfolio of MIT courses to a virtual community of learners
  around the planet.  Further amplifying its impact\, in May 2012\, MIT j
 oined forces with Harvard University to launch\nedX\n\, a partnership in o
 nline education with the ambition to revolutionize learning on campus\, t
 o offer first-rate teaching to learners around the globe\, and to open unp
 recedented paths to learning about learning itself.\n\n\n\nInternational r
 esearch collaborations also grew under Dr. Hockfield’s leadership\, thro
 ugh new and expanded partnerships around the globe\, from Abu Dhabi to Por
 tugal\, and from Singapore to Colombia.  MIT partnered to found several w
 holly new institutions\, including the\nSingapore University of Technolo
 gy and Design\nand the\nMasdar Institute of Science and Technology\n.\n\n\
 n\nDr. Hockfield was the first woman to lead MIT\, a development welcome 
 at an Institute where nearly half the undergraduates are now women. A sign
 ature of her presidency was her vocal commitment to making MIT a leader in
  building diversity all along the pipeline of talent.  In November 2008\,
  she convened MIT’s first-ever Diversity Leadership Congress\, a gatheri
 ng of 300 leaders from across the Institute committed to cultivating a cul
 ture of inclusion that allows everyone to contribute at the peak of their 
 ability.  These efforts led to a marked increase in women and minority sc
 holars joining the MIT faculty.\n\n\n\nBefore returning to MIT following h
 er presidency\, Dr. Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship
  at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\, and the 
 Carnegie Corporation/Vartan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowship at the America
 n Academy of Rome.  She is an elected member of the\nAmerican Academy of 
 Arts and Sciences\nand an elected fellow of the\nAmerican Association for 
 the Advancement of Science\n\, where she is the chairman.  She also serve
 s as a director of the\nCharles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\,\nCouncil on Fo
 reign Relations\, Partners HealthCare System\,\nand the\nBelfer Center for
  Science and International Affairs\n\, and is a life member of the\nMIT Co
 rporation\n.\nShe has served as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey with the U
 .S. Department of State.\n\nDr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees from many
  institutions\, including\nBrown University\, Duke University\, Georgetown
  University\, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine\, Northeastern University\, Tsi
 nghua University (Beijing)\, Université Pierre et Marie Curie\, Universi
 ty of Edinburgh\, University of Massachusetts Medical School\, University 
 of Rochester\n\, and the\nWatson School of Biological Sciences at the Cold
  Spring Harbor Laboratory\n.  Her accomplishments have also been recogniz
