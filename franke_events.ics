DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMariano Sigman was born in Argentina and g
 rew up in Barcelona\, Spain. He obtained a master degree in physics at the
  University of Buenos Aires and a PhD in neuroscience in New York. He move
 d to Paris to investigate decision making\, cognitive architecture and con
 sciousness. In 2006 he founded the Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory\, a
 t the University of Buenos Aires\, an interdisciplinary group integrated 
 by physicists\, psychologists\, biologists\, engineers\, educational scien
 tists\, linguists\, mathematicians\, artists and computer scientists.\n\nH
 is lab has developed an empirical and theoretical approach to decision m
 aking\, with special focus on understanding the construction of confidence
  and subjective beliefs. Many aspects of his investigation rely on data m
 ining and computational tools on massive corpus of human behavior (text\, 
 decision making…). Recently\, he has progressively shifted his research 
 to understand how current knowledge of the brain and the mind may serve to
  improve educational practice. Many of the projects conduct are developed 
 at schools throughout the country and he is extending these investigations
  on cognitive development to hundreds of thousands of children through the
  One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) framework.\n\nThroughout his career he develo
 ped numerous research interactions with representatives of different domai
 ns of human culture including\, musicians\, professional chess players\, m
 athematicians\, magicians\, visual artists and chefs. Several of these int
 eractions resulted in exhibits presented in museums and galleries in Argen
 tina\, Mexico\, Brazil\, US\, Japan\, New York\, Austria.\n\nMariano is th
 e only Latin American scientist to be a director of the Human Brain Projec
 t\, was awarded a Human Frontiers Career Development Award\, the national
