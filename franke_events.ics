SUMMARY:Reckoning and Judgment:  The Promise of AI\, Talk by Brian Cantwel
 l Smith
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200127T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200127T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nNew developments in Artificial Intelligenc
 e – particularly deep learning and other forms of “second-wave” AI 
 – are attracting enormous public attention.  Both triumphalists and doo
 msayers are predicting that human-level AI is “just around the corner.
 ”  To assess the situation we need a broad understanding of intelligenc
 e in terms of which to assess: (i) what kinds of intelligence machines cur
 rently have\, and will likely have in the future\; and (ii) what kinds peo
 ple have\, and may be capable of in the future.  As a first step in this 
 direction\, our speaker distinguishes two kinds of intelligence: (i) “re
 ckoning\,” the kind of calculative rationality that computers excel at\,
  including both first- and second-wave AI\; and (ii) “judgment\,” a fo
 rm of dispassionate\, deliberative thought\, grounded in ethical commitmen
 t and responsible action\, that is appropriate to the situation in which i
 t is deployed.  AI will develop world-changing reckoning systems\, he arg
 ues\, but nothing in AI as currently conceived approaches what is required
  to build a system capable of judgment.\n\n_______________________________

SUMMARY:YQI/Franke Nontechnical Talk - Werner Sun - Taking a Random Walk: 
 a scientific approach to art
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200129T003000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200129T013000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nTaking a Random Walk: a scientific approac
 h to art\n\nJoin us for the 10th talk of Yale Quantum Institute series of
  nontechnical talks aiming to bring a new regard to quantum physics and ST
 EM by having experts cast new light on often-overlooked aspects of scienti
 fic work. For this event\, we will investigate science and art with visual
  artist Werner Sun.\n\nAs two ways of knowing the world\, art and science
  have been labeled either as diametric opposites or as strange bedfellows.
  Can both descriptions be correct? Ithaca-based visual artist with exhibi
 tions in north America\, Werner Sun discusses how his background in physic
 s informs his work with sculpted images\, in order to spark a conversation
  about the intersection of art and science.\n\nTalk open to all and will b
 e accessible to students\, researchers\, the wider university public and t
 he New Haven Community. This event is co-sponsored by\nThe Franke Program
  in Science and the Humanities\n\nGet your free ticket here\n\n\nhttps://f

 ichard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 wi
 ll be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or ar
 t project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connectio
 ns between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art p
 rojects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or 
 content. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between
  junior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwarde
 es will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and
  our benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to pre
 sent the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFell
