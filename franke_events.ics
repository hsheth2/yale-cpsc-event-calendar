DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220928T190000

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe look forward to continuing our Nature o
 f Inference colloquium series with a virtual talk by Alexander Paseau\, Pr
 ofessor of Mathematical Philosophy at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe tit
 le of Professor Paseau’s talk is Inference: A Logical-Philosophical Per
 spective.\n\nIn this talk\, Professor Paseau will describe some of his wor
 k on inference within mathematics and more generally. Inferences can be us
 efully divided into deductive or non-deductive. Formal logic studies deduc
 tive inference\, the obvious question here being: which formal logic corre
 ctly captures it? His view\, defended in his recent monograph\nOne True Lo
 gic\n(Oxford UP\, co-authored with Owen Griffiths)\, is that any such logi
 c must be highly infinite. In this Inference Project event\, he shall expl
 ain what this means and sketch some arguments for it.\n\nThe other side of
  the coin is non-deductive inference. This is much harder to capture preci
 sely\, but many interesting and important things can still be said about i
 t. Professor Paseau will present some of his ideas about non-deductive rea
 soning in mathematics and explain why\, contrary to current and traditiona
 l thinking\, it can be a source not just of justified belief but also know
 ledge.\n\nWhat links the two halves of the talk? The idea that inference\,
  both deductive and non-deductive\, is more permissive than often imagined
 .\n\nProfessor Gila Sher of the University of California\, San Diego will 
 be the conversant for this event.  As a philosophy professor\, her resear
 ch interests center on foundational issues in epistemology\, the philosoph
 y of logic\, and the theory of truth. Her books include:\nThe Bounds of Lo
 gic: A Generalized Viewpoint\n(MIT\, 1991)\,\nEpistemic Friction: An Essay
  on Knowledge\, Truth\, and Logic\n(Oxford\, 2016)\, and\nLogical Conseque
 nce\n(Cambridge\, 2022). She is currently working on a book tentatively ti
 tled\nTruth as a Human Value\n\, which offers a reconception of the philos
 ophy of truth in light of the post-truth crisis.\n\nRegister in advance fo

 e other side of the coin is non-deductive inference. This is much harder t
 o capture precisely\, but many interesting and important things can still

SUMMARY:Talk by Acclaimed Journalist Esther Honig
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20221116T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20221116T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJoin us on Wednesday\, November 16 at 4 p.
 m. for a remarkable talk by journalist\nEsther Honig\n.\n\nIt was early sp
 ring\, nearly 15 years ago\, when Belen Delgado made the discovery of a li
 fetime. As a fisherman in rural Mexico\, Belen had a hunch that a giant ba
 nk of Callo de Hacha\, a rare and incredibly expensive shellfish\, lay jus
 t off the shore of his small coastal town. Together with friends\, he hire
 d a diver to plunge 70 feet below the surface and when he emerged the dive
 r confirmed Belen’s suspicion\, “wherever you step\,” he said\, “t
 here’s callo.” The colony of Callo de Hacha covered 30 miles of ocean 
 floor and was worth millions of dollars. This was the financial windfall t
 he town desperately needed\, but Belen wasn’t prepared for the chaos and
  greed that soon followed as his fellow fishermen succumbed to the “Whit
 e Gold Fever.” This story was produced for the podcast Snap Judgment in 
 partnership with FERN\, the Food and Environment Reporting Network. It exp
 lores overfishing\, climate change and the limitation of government regula
 tions when matched against the needs of people who are working to put food
  on the table.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zo
