DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub

 n\n“The Age of Living Machines:  How Biology Will Build the Next Techno
 logy Revolution”\n\nWith an anticipated world population of over 9.5 bil
 lion by 2050\, we face an unprecedented challenge to sustainably provide s
 ufficient food\, water\, energy and healthcare.  Convergence\, the mergin
 g of previously distinct disciplines\, has emerged as a powerful model wit
 h untold potential to drive a new cycle of innovation-based economic grow
 th.  Bringing together insights and discoveries from the life\, engineer
 ing\, computation and physical sciences holds the promise of accelerating 
 discovery and the development of new technologies to meet the 21st century
 ’s needs.  Promoting convergence approaches in education and research c
 an pave the way to the discoveries and technologies that will transform ou
 r world.\n\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished herself in a career that has
  spanned advanced scientific research and the presidency of one of the pre
 mier institutions of science and engineering in the world.\n\nAfter earnin
 g a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester and a Ph.D. from Geor
 getown University at the School of Medicine\, carrying out her doctoral re
 search at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\, Dr. Hockfield was an 
 NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of California at San Francisco\
 n. She then joined the scientific staff at the\nCold Spring Harbor Laborat
 ory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYale University\nin 1985\, Dr. H
 ockfield focused her research on the development of the brain and on gliom
 a\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneered the use of monoclonal
  antibody technology demonstrating that early experience results in lastin
 g changes in the molecular structure of the brain.  She gained tenure in 
 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilbert Professor of Neurobiology\n
 .\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong\, innovative university l
 eader\, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences\, with o
 versight of more than 70 graduate programs\, and then as provost\, Yale’
 s chief academic and administrative officer.\n\nFrom December 2004 through
  June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth president of MIT\, wher
 e she continues to hold a faculty appointment as professor of neuroscience
  and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.\n\
 nRegister in advance for this meeting:\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/meeting/reg
 ister/tJAqfuytpzwoG9Engg8fbriHVzaSqiFhX0IH\n\n\n\nUnder her leadership\, 
 in 2006 MIT launched the\nMIT Energy Initiative\n(\nMITEI)\n\, raising mor
 e than $350 million to accelerate research\, policy and education towards
  a sustainable energy future.  In recognition of MITEI’s momentum\, in 
 October 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a major energy address 
 at MIT and visited its research laboratories\, the first American Presiden
 t ever to do so.  In 2015\, she served as a member of a Congressional Com
 mission evaluating the U.S. Department of Energy laboratories.\n\n\n\nAs t
 he first life scientist to lead MIT\, she championed the breakthroughs eme
 rging from the historic convergence of the life sciences with the engineer
 ing and physical sciences\, in fields from clean energy to cancer\, includ
 ing the founding of MIT’s\nDavid H. Koch Institute for Integrative Canc
 er Research\,\nthe\nInstitute for Medical Engineering and Science\,\nand t
 he\nRagon Institute of MGH\, MIT and Harvard\n.  Dr. Hockfield’s book\,
 \nThe Age of Living Machines\n(2019)\, focuses on this historic convergenc
 e of the life sciences and engineering – a story that holds the promise 
 of overcoming some of the greatest humanitarian\, medical\, and environmen
 tal challenges of our time.\n\n\n\nLong an advocate for the research unive
 rsity as an engine of innovation and economic growth\, Dr. Hockfield also 
 helped shape national policy on energy technology and next-generation manu
 facturing.  In June 2011\, President Obama appointed her co-chair of the 
 steering committee of the\nAdvanced Manufacturing Partnership\n\, a workin
 g coalition of academic\, government and industry leaders.\n\n\n\nIn keepi
 ng with MIT’s entrepreneurial spirit and signature strength in working w
 ith industry\, she actively fostered the burgeoning\nKendall Square innova
 tion cluster\n\, populated by global giants and startups in the emerging f
 rontiers of biotech\, IT and energy\, with many tracing their roots to MI
 T.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield argued forcefully for the value of MIT’s\nglobal
  engagement\n.  She actively expanded the Institute’s international edu
 cation and research activities.  Building on the success of MIT OpenCour
 seWare in bringing high quality educational materials to learners the worl
 d over\, in early 2012\, Dr. Hockfield accelerated the conversation around
  cost\, quality and access in higher education with the launch of\nMITx\n
 .  This online learning initiative offers a laboratory for experimenting
  with the use of new learning technologies and provides a portfolio of MI
 T courses to a virtual community of learners around the planet.  Further
  amplifying its impact\, in May 2012\, MIT joined forces with Harvard Uni
 versity to launch\nedX\n\, a partnership in online education with the ambi
 tion to revolutionize learning on campus\, to offer first-rate teaching t
 o learners around the globe\, and to open unprecedented paths to learning 
 about learning itself.\n\n\n\nInternational research collaborations also g
 rew under Dr. Hockfield’s leadership\, through new and expanded partners
 hips around the globe\, from Abu Dhabi to Portugal\, and from Singapore to
  Colombia.  MIT partnered to found several wholly new institutions\, inc
 luding the\nSingapore University of Technology and Design\nand the\nMasda
 r Institute of Science and Technology\n.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield was the fir
 st woman to lead MIT\, a development welcome at an Institute where nearly 
 half the undergraduates are now women. A signature of her presidency was h
 er vocal commitment to making MIT a leader in building diversity all along
  the pipeline of talent.  In November 2008\, she convened MIT’s first-e
 ver Diversity Leadership Congress\, a gathering of 300 leaders from across
  the Institute committed to cultivating a culture of inclusion that allows
  everyone to contribute at the peak of their ability.  These efforts led 
 to a marked increase in women and minority scholars joining the MIT facult
 y.\n\n\n\nBefore returning to MIT following her presidency\, Dr. Hockfield
  held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship at Harvard University’s Jo
 hn F. Kennedy School of Government\, and the Carnegie Corporation/Vartan G
 regorian Affiliated Fellowship at the American Academy of Rome.  She is a
 n elected member of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\nand an ele
 cted fellow of the\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science\n\
 , where she is the chairman.  She also serves as a director of the\nCharl
 es Stark Draper Laboratory\n\,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\, Partners He
 althCare System\,\nand the\nBelfer Center for Science and International Af
 fairs\n\, and is a life member of the\nMIT Corporation\n.\nShe has served
  as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey with the U.S. Department of State.\n\n
 Dr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees from many institutions\, including\nB
 rown University\, Duke University\, Georgetown University\, Mt. Sinai Scho
 ol of Medicine\, Northeastern University\, Tsinghua University (Beijing)\,
  Université Pierre et Marie Curie\, University of Edinburgh\, University
  of Massachusetts Medical School\, University of Rochester\n\, and the\nWa
 tson School of Biological Sciences at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\n.
