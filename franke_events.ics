DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe act of creating an inclusive and conne
 ctive network of all musical practices – sung\, played\, written\, and u
 nwritten ­– quickly reveals flaws in the hierarchies and priorities tha
 t have largely mapped the geography of Early Modern music history.  But s
 uch charting can also offer the chance for revision\, that is\, to move ac
 ross the historically constructed (and still not outdated) boundaries of 
 “central” and “peripheral” styles\, “greater” and “lesser”
  composers\, singular and plural modes of performance\, notated and improv
 ised practices\, and the border between original compositions and their ad
 aptations.  In this talk\, Professor Victor Coelho of Boston University p
 roposes a more “polycentric” template for understanding music history 
 between ca. 1420-1600\, drawing on several case-studies dealing with perfo
 rmance\, sound\, notation\, and transmission as examples of why a history 
 formed of many discrete parts with their individual stylistic constellatio
 ns may be preferable than attempts at constructing a unified musical unive
 rse.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/webi
