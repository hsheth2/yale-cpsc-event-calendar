DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe
 l.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your exciting ideas!\n\n\nhttps://frankep

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  “On Experiments for Caus
 al Inference and System Identification”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210317T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210317T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nVirtual talk by Professor Dr. Nihat Ay\n\n
 Registration details to follow.\n\nAbstract: In the first part of my prese
 ntation\, I will provide an introduction to the field of causal networks. 
 I will focus on instructive simple examples in order to highlight the core
  conceptual and philosophical ideas that underly the theory. This approach
  provides a clear semantics that allows us to distinguish between causatio
 n and correlation. It also allows us to study how cause-effect relations g
 ive rise to particular kinds of correlations\, which can then be exploited
  for inferring causal relations from correlations. However\, this kind of 
 inference\, which is based on observations only\, turns out to be rather l
 imited. In addition to observing a system\, one can also apply experimenta
 l interventions and thereby reveal causal structures that would not follow
  from correlational information.  This is one instance of system identifi
 cation through experimental perturbations. I will conclude my presentation
  with an extension of the interventional calculus by a “knockout calculu
 s” which is based on a kind of structural intervention. This allows us t
 o reveal a more fine-grained causal description of the underlying system.\
 n\nBio: Nihat Ay studied mathematics and physics at the Ruhr University B
 ochum and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Leipzig
  in 2001. In 2003 and 2004\, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe 
 Institute and at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute (now the Redwood Cente
 r for Theoretical Neuroscience at UC Berkeley). After his postdoctoral sta
 y in the USA he became an assistant professor (wissenschaftlicher Assisten
 t) at the Mathematical Institute of the Friedrich Alexander University in 
 Erlangen. Since September 2005\, he works as Max Planck Research Group Lea
 der at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig
  where he is heading the group Information Theory of Cognitive Systems. As
  professor of the Santa Fe Institute he is involved in research on complex
 ity and robustness theory. Since December 2013\, he is affiliated with the
  Leipzig University as Honorary Professor for Information Geometry. He re
 cently accepted an offer from the Hamburg University of Technology where h
 e is going to build up a new institute\, the institute of Data Science Fou
 ndations\, as part of the Technology and Innovation Center at the Hamburg 
 Innovation Port (\nhttps://www.hamburg-innovation-port.com/\n).\n\n\nhttps

 r Columbus lived the vast majority of his life in a Mediterranean world in
  which the Ottoman and Mamluk Empires dominated the eastern part of the se
 a and were in constant economic\, political\, and confrontational interact
 ion with the Christian states of Europe. This talk considers the importanc
 e of Islam in shaping Columbus’s life and voyages. In doing so\, it thin
 ks critically about the role of Islam in the Spanish decision to send him 
 across the ocean and in the early history of the Spanish Caribbean. It fur
 thermore uses this Muslim history of Columbus to suggest ways of analyzing
  early modern periodization and the place of Islam in the making of the mo
 dern world.\n\n\n\nAlan Mikhail is a historian of the early modern Muslim

 tin of the History of Medicine\; and\, in Arabic\, in al-Rūznāma\, Akh
 bār al-Adab\, and Wijhāt Naẓar.\n\n\n\nHe is the recipient of the Rog
 er Owen Award of the Middle East Studies Association\, the Alice Hamilton

 v Ranis and Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Prizes.\n\n\n\nProfessor Mikhail curr
 ently serves on the editorial boards of Cambridge Studies in Islamic Civil
 ization and the Palgrave Macmillan Series in World Environmental History\,
  as well as the International Journal of Turkish Studies and Environmen
 tal History.  He was formerly on the editorial board of the Internationa

SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Lyanda Lynn Haupt\, Author of
  Mozart’s Starling
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nDetails to follow soon.  More on the subj
 ect of Lyanda’s book and talk topic follows:\n\n“The story of the comp
 oser and his pet bird led me on an unexpected journey to Vienna and Salzbu
 rg. It led me into the workings of the symphony\, the opera\, ornithologic
 al labs\, the depths of music theory\, the field of linguistics\, and the 
 nature of creative inspiration. It led me to the crazy experience of raisi
 ng a starling in my own home. It led me deep into the spirit of the natura
 l world and our constant wild animal companions.\nIt led me to the underst
 anding that there is more possibility in our relationships with animals—
 with all the creatures of the earth\, not just the traditionally beautiful
 \, or endangered\, or loved—than I had ever imagined.”\n\nRegister in
