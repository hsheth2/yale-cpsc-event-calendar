DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMariano Sigman was born in Argentina and g
 rew up in Barcelona\, Spain. He obtained a master degree in physics at the
  University of Buenos Aires and a PhD in neuroscience in New York. He move
 d to Paris to investigate decision making\, cognitive architecture and con
 sciousness. In 2006 he founded the Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory\, a
 t the University of Buenos Aires\, an interdisciplinary group integrated 
 by physicists\, psychologists\, biologists\, engineers\, educational scien
 tists\, linguists\, mathematicians\, artists and computer scientists.\n\nH
 is lab has developed an empirical and theoretical approach to decision m
 aking\, with special focus on understanding the construction of confidence
  and subjective beliefs. Many aspects of his investigation rely on data m
 ining and computational tools on massive corpus of human behavior (text\, 
 decision making…). Recently\, he has progressively shifted his research 
 to understand how current knowledge of the brain and the mind may serve to
  improve educational practice. Many of the projects conduct are developed 
 at schools throughout the country and he is extending these investigations
  on cognitive development to hundreds of thousands of children through the
  One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) framework.\n\nThroughout his career he develo
 ped numerous research interactions with representatives of different domai
 ns of human culture including\, musicians\, professional chess players\, m
 athematicians\, magicians\, visual artists and chefs. Several of these int
 eractions resulted in exhibits presented in museums and galleries in Argen
 tina\, Mexico\, Brazil\, US\, Japan\, New York\, Austria.\n\nMariano is th
 e only Latin American scientist to be a director of the Human Brain Projec
 t\, was awarded a Human Frontiers Career Development Award\, the national 
 prize of physics\, the young investigator prize of “College de France”
 \, the IBM Scalable Data Analytics award and is a scholar of the James S.

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
