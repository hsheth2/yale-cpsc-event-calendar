DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nRemember our Eureka! contest?  Thanks to 
 the pandemic and the alterations in our life that it has caused\, we decid
 ed to re-orient our energies and effort slightly to help many of you who a
 re suddenly faced with the task of educating your kids at home.  In colla
 boration with MIT’s Full Steam Ahead Project\, who have considerable exp
 ertise in early childhood education\, and keeping with the Franke Program 
 spirit\, we would like to offer videos that teach basic scientific concept
 s using creative and original visual means unrestricted by disciplinary b
 oundaries.\n\nIn order to help engage young curious minds\, we have embark
 ed on this project to collate 100 simple science experiments that can be d
 one at home with simple everyday materials.  We are soliciting ideas from
  everyone.  Details can be found on the\nproject website\n.\n\nPlease sub
 mit your ideas for videos of experiments\;  if selected\, you will be inv
 ited to send in your video.  Plus\, everyone is invited to also upload th
 eir own versions of the selected videos for sharing on our\nYouTube Channe
 l.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your exciting ideas!\n\n\nhttps://frankep

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  “Why do Groups Polarize 
 over Matters of Fact? What Models Can and Cannot Tell Us”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210525T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210525T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nJames Owen Weatherall\, Professor in the D
 epartment of Logic and Philosophy of Science\, University of California at
  Irvine\n\nOne striking feature of the current political environment in th
 e United States and elsewhere is that there are large groups with divergen
 t beliefs about matters of fact\, including ones where there is a rich and
  widely accessible body of scientific evidence available that clearly favo
 rs one side.  This talk will draw on recent modeling work to provide thre
 e distinct possible explanations of this polarization in belief\, each of 
 which invokes different mechanisms and recommends different remedies.  Pr
 ofessor Weatherall will conclude with a discussion of what it means\, from
  the perspective of the epistemology of model-based science\, that such di
 fferent models can produce such similar outcomes.  The moral will be to c
 aution against overly simplistic explanations of and silver bullet solutio
 ns to our current quandary in political epistemology.\n\nProfessor Kevin 
 Dorst of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh will
  lead a post-talk conversation the next day\, May 26th\, at 3 p.m.\n\nRegi
