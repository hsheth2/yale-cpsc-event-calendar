SUMMARY:Distinguished Speaker Series Talk by Lyanda Lynn Haupt\, “Mozart
 ’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Language\, and the Human Relationship with
  the Natural World”
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T200000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210427T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nMozart’s Starling: A Story of Art\, Lang
 uage\, and the Human Relationship with the Natural World\n\nThe story soun
 ds apocryphal\, but it’s actually true.  In the spring of 1784\, Mozart
  found a starling in a Viennese shop mimicking the motif from one of his o
 wn concertos\, and he took the bird home as a pet.  How did it come to pa
 ss that the sublime classical composer found inspiration in one of the wor
 ld’s most ecologically despised species?  The answer leads to a beautif
 ul tangle of music theory\, linguistics\, the nature of creative inspirati
 on\, and the human relationship with the wild earth.\n\nRegister in advanc
 e for this meeting\nhere\n(\nhttps://yale.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwqcui
