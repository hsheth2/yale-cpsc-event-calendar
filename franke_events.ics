DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nAn ambitious\, rock-climbing geology stude
 nt defies her imperious advisor to travel to the Nevada high desert\, wher
 e a career-defining discovery and an unexpected friendship with a young ca
 ttle rancher force her to make life-altering decisions. Unconformity is th
 e story of a friendship tested in the American West\, framed by geology\, 
 rock climbing\, land rights\, exploitation in academia\, and the climate c
 risis.\n\nJoin us for a post-film moderated conversation with writer and d
 irector Jonathan DiMaio ‘09.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/f

SUMMARY:Inference Project Talk and Discussion:  Alexander Paseau
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220928T190000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220928T200000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe look forward to continuing our Nature o
 f Inference colloquium series with a virtual talk by Alexander Paseau\, Pr
 ofessor of Mathematical Philosophy at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe tit
 le of Professor Paseau’s talk is Inference: A Logical-Philosophical Per
 spective.\n\nIn this talk\, Professor Paseau will describe some of his wor
 k on inference within mathematics and more generally. Inferences can be us
 efully divided into deductive or non-deductive. Formal logic studies deduc
 tive inference\, the obvious question here being: which formal logic corre
 ctly captures it? His view\, defended in his recent monograph\nOne True Lo
 gic\n(Oxford UP\, co-authored with Owen Griffiths)\, is that any such logi
 c must be highly infinite. In this Inference Project event\, he shall expl
 ain what this means and sketch some arguments for it.\n\nThe other side of
  the coin is non-deductive inference. This is much harder to capture preci
 sely\, but many interesting and important things can still be said about i
 t. Professor Paseau will present some of his ideas about non-deductive rea
 soning in mathematics and explain why\, contrary to current and traditiona
 l thinking\, it can be a source not just of justified belief but also know
 ledge.\n\nWhat links the two halves of the talk? The idea that inference\,
  both deductive and non-deductive\, is more permissive than often imagined
