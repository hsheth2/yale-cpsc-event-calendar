SUMMARY:Distinguished Lecturer Series\, Talk by Susan Hockfield
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210301T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20210301T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n“The Age of Machines:  How Biology Will
  Build the Next Technology Revolution”\n\nWith an anticipated world popu
 lation of over 9.5 billion by 2050\, we face an unprecedented challenge to
  sustainably provide sufficient food\, water\, energy and healthcare.  Co
 nvergence\, the merging of previously distinct disciplines\, has emerged a
 s a powerful model with untold potential to drive a new cycle of innovati
 on-based economic growth.  Bringing together insights and discoveries fr
 om the life\, engineering\, computation and physical sciences holds the pr
 omise of accelerating discovery and the development of new technologies to
  meet the 21st century’s needs.  Promoting Convergence approaches in ed
 ucation and research can pave the way to the discoveries and technologies 
 that will transform our world.\n\nSusan Hockfield has distinguished hersel
 f in a career that has spanned advanced scientific research and the presid
 ency of one of the premier institutions of science and engineering in the 
 world.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester
  and a Ph.D. from Georgetown University at the School of Medicine\, carryi
 ng out her doctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\,
  Dr. Hockfield was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the\nUniversity of Calif
 ornia at San Francisco\n. She then joined the scientific staff at the\nCol
 d Spring Harbor Laboratory\nin New York. Joining the faculty of\nYale Univ
 ersity\nin 1985\, Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the development of
  the brain and on glioma\, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneere
 d the use of monoclonal antibody technology demonstrating that early exper
 ience results in lasting changes in the molecular structure of the brain. 
  She gained tenure in 1994 and was named the\nWilliam Edward Gilbert Prof
 essor of Neurobiology\n.\n\nAt Yale\, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong\, 
 innovative university leader\, first as dean of its Graduate School of Art
 s and Sciences\, with oversight of more than 70 graduate programs\, and th
 en as provost\, Yale’s chief academic and administrative officer.\n\nFro
 m December 2004 through June 2012\, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth 
 president of MIT\, where she continues to hold a faculty appointment as pr
 ofessor of neuroscience and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrat
 ive Cancer Research.\n\nRegister in advance for this meeting:\n\nhttps://y
 ale.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAqfuytpzwoG9Engg8fbriHVzaSqiFhX0IH\n\n\n\nU
 nder her leadership\, in 2006 MIT launched the\nMIT Energy Initiative\n(\
 nMITEI)\n\, raising more than $350 million to accelerate research\, polic
 y and education towards a sustainable energy future.  In recognition of M
 ITEI’s momentum\, in October 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama delivered 
 a major energy address at MIT and visited its research laboratories\, the 
 first American President ever to do so.  In 2015\, she served as a member
  of a Congressional Commission evaluating the U.S. Department of Energy la
 boratories.\n\n\n\nAs the first life scientist to lead MIT\, she champione
 d the breakthroughs emerging from the historic convergence of the life sci
 ences with the engineering and physical sciences\, in fields from clean en
 ergy to cancer\, including the founding of MIT’s\nDavid H. Koch Institu
 te for Integrative Cancer Research\,\nthe\nInstitute for Medical Engineeri
 ng and Science\,\nand the\nRagon Institute of MGH\, MIT and Harvard\n.  D
 r. Hockfield’s book\,\nThe Age of Living Machines\n(2019)\, focuses on t
 his historic convergence of the life sciences and engineering – a story 
 that holds the promise of overcoming some of the greatest humanitarian\, m
 edical\, and environmental challenges of our time.\n\n\n\nLong an advocate
  for the research university as an engine of innovation and economic growt
 h\, Dr. Hockfield also helped shape national policy on energy technology a
 nd next-generation manufacturing.  In June 2011\, President Obama appoint
 ed her co-chair of the steering committee of the\nAdvanced Manufacturing P
 artnership\n\, a working coalition of academic\, government and industry l
 eaders.\n\n\n\nIn keeping with MIT’s entrepreneurial spirit and signatur
 e strength in working with industry\, she actively fostered the burgeoning
 \nKendall Square innovation cluster\n\, populated by global giants and sta
 rtups in the emerging frontiers of biotech\, IT and energy\, with many tra
 cing their roots to MIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Hockfield argued forcefully for the v
 alue of MIT’s\nglobal engagement\n.  She actively expanded the Institut
 e’s international education and research activities.  Building on the 
 success of MIT OpenCourseWare in bringing high quality educational materia
 ls to learners the world over\, in early 2012\, Dr. Hockfield accelerated 
 the conversation around cost\, quality and access in higher education wit
 h the launch of\nMITx\n.  This online learning initiative offers a labor
 atory for experimenting with the use of new learning technologies and prov
 ides a portfolio of MIT courses to a virtual community of learners aroun
 d the planet.  Further amplifying its impact\, in May 2012\, MIT joined 
 forces with Harvard University to launch\nedX\n\, a partnership in online 
 education with the ambition to revolutionize learning on campus\, to offe
 r first-rate teaching to learners around the globe\, and to open unprecede
 nted paths to learning about learning itself.\n\n\n\nInternational researc
 h collaborations also grew under Dr. Hockfield’s leadership\, through ne
 w and expanded partnerships around the globe\, from Abu Dhabi to Portugal\
 , and from Singapore to Colombia.  MIT partnered to found several wholly 
 new institutions\, including the\nSingapore University of Technology and
  Design\nand the\nMasdar Institute of Science and Technology\n.\n\n\n\nDr.
  Hockfield was the first woman to lead MIT\, a development welcome at an 
 Institute where nearly half the undergraduates are now women. A signature 
 of her presidency was her vocal commitment to making MIT a leader in build
 ing diversity all along the pipeline of talent.  In November 2008\, she c
 onvened MIT’s first-ever Diversity Leadership Congress\, a gathering of 
 300 leaders from across the Institute committed to cultivating a culture o
 f inclusion that allows everyone to contribute at the peak of their abilit
 y.  These efforts led to a marked increase in women and minority scholars
  joining the MIT faculty.\n\n\n\nBefore returning to MIT following her pre
 sidency\, Dr. Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship at Ha
 rvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\, and the Carneg
 ie Corporation/Vartan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowship at the American Acad
 emy of Rome.  She is an elected member of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts a
 nd Sciences\nand an elected fellow of the\nAmerican Association for the Ad
 vancement of Science\n\, where she is the chairman.  She also serves as a
  director of the\nCharles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\,\nCouncil on Foreign 
 Relations\, Partners HealthCare System\,\nand the\nBelfer Center for Scien
 ce and International Affairs\n\, and is a life member of the\nMIT Corporat
 ion\n.\nShe has served as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey with the U.S. De
 partment of State.\n\nDr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees from many insti
 tutions\, including\nBrown University\, Duke University\, Georgetown Unive
 rsity\, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine\, Northeastern University\, Tsinghua 
 University (Beijing)\, Université Pierre et Marie Curie\, University of 
 Edinburgh\, University of Massachusetts Medical School\, University of Roc
 hester\n\, and the\nWatson School of Biological Sciences at the Cold Sprin
 g Harbor Laboratory\n.  Her accomplishments have also been recognized by 
 the Charles Judson Herrick Award from the American Association of Anatomis
 ts\, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Award from the Yale University Graduate Schoo
 l\, the Meliora Citation from the University of Rochester\, the Golden Pla
 te Award from the Academy of Achievement\, the Amelia Earhart Award from t
 he Women’s Union\, the Edison Achievement Award\, the Pinnacle Award fo
 r Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\, and t
