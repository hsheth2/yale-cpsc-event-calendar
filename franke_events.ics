 usic Theory and Artificial Intelligence

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe are delighted to present a talk by Dieg
 o Ellis-Soto\, a current Franke Fellow now in his second year with our pro
 gram.\n\nThe movement of large groups of animals – such as flocks of bir
 ds or schooling of fish – often appears harmonic and soothing to the eye
 \, almost as if animal collectives were dancing to some musical rules not 
 visible to the human eye.  Yet at the same time\, the sound of the natura
 l world is increasingly shaped by the timber of the drums of human activit
 ies and habitat destruction across the world.  In this talk\, Ellis-Soto 
 combines new cutting edge technology\, with biological principles and musi
 cal theory to take a dive into representing the lives of animal collective
 s through art and music.  From music on a farm\, art exhibitions\, up to 
 involving of local youth\, we invite you to take the plunge into the sound
 s of animals collectives and ecosystems.\n\nRegister in advance for this w

DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Wisdom Project was born in the wake of
  the COVID-19 pandemic. A group of persons with lived experience with ment
 al health problems has produced a series of webinars\, podcasts and conduc
 ted research on how we can collectively make sense of this global disrupti
 on. This pandemic – far from being a great equalizer – has brought to 
 the fore issues that are at the core of our societies and that we can no l
 onger ignore – systemic racism\, oppression\, poverty and health inequit
 ies. This talk will focus on a series of regional conversations that invit
 ed the voices and experiences of those who have experienced first-hand wha
 t it’s like to survive precarious livelihoods\, racism\, oppression\, ma
 rginalization\, stigma and other unfreedoms.\n\nWe look forward to hosting
  this talk by former Franke Post-doctoral Fellow Ana Florence\, now affili
 ated with Columbia University.\n\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\n\
