DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nWe are delighted to present a talk by Dieg
 o Ellis-Soto\, a current Franke Fellow now in his second year with our pro
 gram.\n\nThe movement of large groups of animals – such as flocks of bir
 ds or schooling of fish – often appears harmonic and soothing to the eye
 \, almost as if animal collectives were dancing to some musical rules not 
 visible to the human eye.  Yet at the same time\, the sound of the natura
 l world is increasingly shaped by the timber of the drums of human activit
 ies and habitat destruction across the world.  In this talk\, Ellis-Soto 
 combines new cutting edge technology\, with biological principles and musi
 cal theory to take a dive into representing the lives of animal collective
 s through art and music.  From music on a farm\, art exhibitions\, up to 
 involving of local youth\, we invite you to take the plunge into the sound
 s of animals collectives and ecosystems.\n\nRegister in advance for this w
