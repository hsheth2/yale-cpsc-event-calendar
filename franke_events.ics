SUMMARY:Reckoning and Judgment:  The Promise of AI\, Talk by Brian Cantwel
 l Smith
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200127T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200127T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nNew developments in Artificial Intelligenc
 e – particularly deep learning and other forms of “second-wave” AI 
 – are attracting enormous public attention.  Both triumphalists and doo
 msayers are predicting that human-level AI is “just around the corner.
 ”  To assess the situation we need a broad understanding of intelligenc
 e in terms of which to assess: (i) what kinds of intelligence machines cur
 rently have\, and will likely have in the future\; and (ii) what kinds peo
 ple have\, and may be capable of in the future.  As a first step in this 
 direction\, our speaker distinguishes two kinds of intelligence: (i) “re
 ckoning\,” the kind of calculative rationality that computers excel at\,
  including both first- and second-wave AI\; and (ii) “judgment\,” a fo
 rm of dispassionate\, deliberative thought\, grounded in ethical commitmen
 t and responsible action\, that is appropriate to the situation in which i
 t is deployed.  AI will develop world-changing reckoning systems\, he arg
 ues\, but nothing in AI as currently conceived approaches what is required
  to build a system capable of judgment.\n\n_______________________________

 lligence and the Human at the University of Toronto\, where he is also Pro
 fessor of Information\, Philosophy\, Cognitive Science\, and the History a

SUMMARY:YQI/Franke Nontechnical Talk - Werner Sun - Taking a Random Walk: 
 a scientific approach to art
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200129T003000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200129T013000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nTaking a Random Walk: a scientific approac
 h to art\n\nJoin us for the 10th talk of Yale Quantum Institute series of
  nontechnical talks aiming to bring a new regard to quantum physics and ST
 EM by having experts cast new light on often-overlooked aspects of scienti
 fic work. For this event\, we will investigate science and art with visual
  artist Werner Sun.\n\nAs two ways of knowing the world\, art and science
  have been labeled either as diametric opposites or as strange bedfellows.
  Can both descriptions be correct? Ithaca-based visual artist with exhibi
 tions in north America\, Werner Sun discusses how his background in physic
 s informs his work with sculpted images\, in order to spark a conversation
  about the intersection of art and science.\n\nTalk open to all and will b
 e accessible to students\, researchers\, the wider university public and t
 he New Haven Community. This event is co-sponsored by\nThe Franke Program
  in Science and the Humanities\n\nGet your free ticket here\n\n\nhttps://f

SUMMARY:Franke Undergraduate Fellowship Competition Now Open
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200307T040000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20200307T050000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the\nFranke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\n\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. R
 ichard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 wi
 ll be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or ar
 t project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connectio
 ns between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art p
 rojects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or 
 content. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between
  junior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwarde
 es will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and
  our benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to pre
 sent the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFell
 owship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed researc
 h or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies an
 d materials.\n\nThe deadline is March 6\, 2020.\n\n\n\nApplication Informa
 tion:\n\n\nApplicants should submit the following materials:\n-  a projec
 t abstract (125 words or less)\n-  a three-page proposal detailing the ob
 jectives of the project\, the means by which it will be carried out\, the 
 applicant’s preparation and motivation for the proposed work\, and how t
 his interdisciplinary project relates to the applicant’s career plans an
 d aspirations\n- a budget outlining project costs\n\nApplicants should arr
 ange for the submission of a letter of recommendation from a faculty proje
 ct mentor.  This individual should identify himself or herself as the men
 tor for the proposed project in the submitted letter. Please request this 
 letter of recommendation well in advance of the deadline.\n\nIf a language
  other than English is needed in order to conduct the proposed project\, a
 pplicants should also arrange for the submission of a language evaluation 
 form by a faculty member. If the applicant is a native speaker of the lang
 uage\, the proposal should mention as much.\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.y
