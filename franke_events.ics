 nars on sympathy\, world Sinophone literature\, and approaches to East Asi
 an intellectual and literary history. From mainland China to Southeast Asi

DTEND:20230310T230000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the\nFranke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\n\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. R
 ichard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 wi
 ll be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or ar
 t project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connectio
 ns between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art p
 rojects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or 
 content. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between
  junior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwarde
 es will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and
  Mrs. Franke to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to present
  the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellowsh
 ip monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research or
  project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and ma
 terials.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/competition-now-open-fr

SUMMARY:We Carry Our World Within Us: Cellular Structures That Allow Us To
  Live in A Hostile Environment
DTSTART:20230426T200000
DTEND:20230426T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe architect Louis Sullivan coined the ph
 rase “form follows function.” While Sullivan was referring to the desi
 gn of human-made edifices\, his words are no less insightful when applied 
 to the realm of biological structure at the microscopic level. Cells are c
 omposed of a remarkable array of sub-cellular structures. In each tissue i
 n our body\, cellular architecture is beautifully adapted to accommodate e
 ach cell type’s specific physiological purpose. This talk will explore t
 he nature and function of some of these subcellular structures\, and discu
 ss their roles in allowing us to persist in often hostile and rapidly chan
 ging external environments.\n\nThis talk will be given by Professor Michae
 l J. Caplan of Yale School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Caplan received his bachelo
 rs degree from Harvard University and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale
  University in 1987. He joined Yale’s Department of Cellular and Molecul
 ar Physiology as a faculty member in 1988\, and is currently the C.N.H. Lo
 ng Professor of Cellular and Molecular Physiology and Cell Biology.\n\nHe 
 has received fellowships from the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation\, the David
  and Lucille Packard Foundation for Science and Engineering\, and a Nation
 al Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. He has a
 lso received the Young Investigator Awards from the American Physiological
  Society and the American Society of Nephrologists.\n\nHis work focuses on
  understanding the ways in which kidney cells organize and maintain their 
 unique structures. His laboratory also studies the mechanisms responsible 
 for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\, and is working to ident
 ify targets for new therapies.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/w
