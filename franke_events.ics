 ering\, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about
  joining the meeting.\n\n\n\nAfter studying physics and astronomy at Calvi
 n University\, Professor Crull took the plunge into interdisciplinary wate
 rs\, earning both an M.A. and Ph.D in History & Philosophy of Science from
  the University of Notre Dame. Before coming to CUNY in 2014\, she held po
 stdoctoral positions at the University of Aberdeen and at the Hebrew Unive
 rsity’s Edelstein Center for History & Philosophy of Science\, Technolog
 y and Medicine (where she spent many blissful hours huddled over documents
  in the Einstein Archives).\nWhile most of her research to date concerns 
 historical and philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics\, Crull is a
 lso drawn to questions in the hinterland between contemporary metaphysics 
 and physics.  In particular\, she is interested in the philosophical impl
 ications of entanglement and quantum decoherence – how these phenomena m
 odify traditional views about the structure of space and time\, and what e
 xplanatory roles they might play within various approaches to quantum grav
 ity.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/inference-project-talk-and-
