SUMMARY:Nature and Artifice: Korean Munbangdo Painting
DTSTART:20230406T203000
DTEND:20230406T213000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThinking Environment in Early Modernity is
  a speaker series focused on intermedial problems of conceptualizing and r
 epresenting the environment\, both in the Early Modern period and in trans
 historical contexts. Eleanor Soo-ah Hyun (Metropolitan Museum of Art) will
  deliver a talk entitled\, “Nature and Artifice: Korean Munbangdo Painti
 ng” on Thursday\, April 6th at 4:30pm in HQ 276 (Humanities Quadrangle).
  The lecture will also be broadcast over Zoom at\nthis link\n. There will 
 be a small reception with refreshments afterwards.\n\nMunbangdo is a Korea
 n still-life painting genre that emerged in the 18th century and continued
  to be popular into the mid-20th century. The paintings reflect contempora
 neous global trends of collecting\, display and trade. In addition to intr
 oducing the genre\, the talk will focus on the depicted naturalia\, their 
 symbolism and connections to artifice and amusement.\n\nThinking Environme
 nt in Early Modernity is co-sponsored by The Franke Program in Science and
  the Humanities\, the Program in Early Modern Studies\, and the Council fo
 r East Asian Studies. For more information on the series\, please contact

SUMMARY:Histories and Counter-Histories of CGI in Movies\, Talk by Theodor
 e Kim
DTSTART:20230412T200000
DTEND:20230412T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe history of computer-generated imagery 
 (CGI) in movies is often presented as a hero’s journey. Starting in the 
 1980s\, a scrappy group of computer scientists went up against the large\,
  powerful\, but inert\, Hollywood studio empire\, and forever changed how 
 movies are made. Our guest\,\nProfessor Theodore Kim\n\, will present that
  history\, and a counter-history that reads like this:  Starting in the 1
 980s\, a scrappy group of computer scientists ensured that historical bias
 es towards young\, white skin and straight\, blond hair embedded in film a
 nd photography technology would be carried over from the analog era into t
 he digital.\n\nKim will conclude with efforts to confront and counter thes
 e racially charged biases after the murder of George Floyd. This is a mult
 i-year\, multi-institution effort spanning the sciences\, arts and humanit
 ies\, and includes his group at Yale.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/

SUMMARY:G-Man:  J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century
DTSTART:20230418T200000
DTEND:20230418T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nFor nearly a half-century\, J. Edgar Hoove
 r was director of the FBI or its precursor. A rabid anti-Communist now kno
 wn for his own law-breaking — specifically\, for his secret surveillance
  of American citizens — he is often caricatured as a bulldog.\n\nBut in 
 her new biography\n“G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the America
 n Century”\n(Viking)\, Yale historian Beverly Gage reveals new informati
 on about the legendary government man (“G-man’) and portrays him as a 
 complicated person\, one full of contradictions. Her talk will examine the
  controversial life and times of Hoover and place him back where he once 
 stood in American political history—not at the fringes\, but at the cent
 er—using his story to explain the trajectories of governance\, policing\
 , race\, ideology\, political culture\, and federal power as they evolved 
 over the course of the 20th century.\n\nThe book was listed among the top 
 10 books of 2022 by the\nWashington Post\n\, the\nAtlantic\n\, and\nPublis
 hers Weekly\n\, and was on\nThe New York Times\n’ list of the 100 best b
 ooks of 2022.\nThe New Yorker\nchose it as one of its 24 “Essential Read
 s” of 2022.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/g-man-j-edgar-hoov

SUMMARY:We Carry Our World Within Us: Cellular Structures That Allow Us To
  Live in A Hostile Environment
DTSTART:20230426T200000
DTEND:20230426T210000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe architect Louis Sullivan coined the ph
 rase “form follows function.” While Sullivan was referring to the desi
 gn of human-made edifices\, his words are no less insightful when applied 
 to the realm of biological structure at the microscopic level. Cells are c
 omposed of a remarkable array of sub-cellular structures. In each tissue i
 n our body\, cellular architecture is beautifully adapted to accommodate e
 ach cell type’s specific physiological purpose. This talk will explore t
 he nature and function of some of these subcellular structures\, and discu
 ss their roles in allowing us to persist in often hostile and rapidly chan
 ging external environments.\n\nThis talk will be given by Professor Michae
 l J. Caplan of Yale School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Caplan received his bachelo
 rs degree from Harvard University and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale
  University in 1987. He joined Yale’s Department of Cellular and Molecul
 ar Physiology as a faculty member in 1988\, and is currently the C.N.H. Lo
 ng Professor of Cellular and Molecular Physiology and Cell Biology.\n\nHe 
 has received fellowships from the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation\, the David
  and Lucille Packard Foundation for Science and Engineering\, and a Nation
 al Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. He has a
 lso received the Young Investigator Awards from the American Physiological
  Society and the American Society of Nephrologists.\n\nHis work focuses on
  understanding the ways in which kidney cells organize and maintain their 
 unique structures. His laboratory also studies the mechanisms responsible 
 for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\, and is working to ident
 ify targets for new therapies.\n\n\nhttps://frankeprogram.yale.edu/event/w
