SUMMARY:POSTPONED:  Inference Project Virtual Talk:  Causality at the Inte
 rsection of Simulation\, Inference\, Science\, and Learning
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220118T210000
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220118T220000
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\n**Please note this talk is being postponed
  until further notice.  We hope to offer it early in 2022.  We shall con
 firm the exact date closer to the time.**\n\nhe sciences are replete with 
 high-fidelity simulators: computational manifestations of causal\, mechani
 stic models. Ironically\, while these simulators provide our highest-fidel
 ity physical models\, they are not well suited for inferring properties of
  the model from data. In this talk\, Professor Kyle Cranmer of the Departm
 ent of Physics of New York University will describe the emerging area of s
 imulation-based inference and describe how machine learning is being broug
 ht to bear on these challenging problems. It is then tempting to imagine t
 he path towards developing an autonomous AI scientist also responsible for
  designing experiments and hypothesis generation. Interestingly\, this fra
 ming brings a new perspective on the role of causality and agency that inc
 orporates recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 \n\nThe moderated post-talk conversation will take place on Monday\, Decem
 ber 20 at 4 p.m.\, and the conversant will soon be confirmed.\n\nRegister

SUMMARY:Franke Undergraduate Fellowship Grants for 2021/2022
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T224500
DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20220311T234500
DESCRIPTION:Event description:\nThe Franke Program in Science and the Huma
 nities is pleased to award the Franke Fellowship in Science and the Human
 ities\, which is made possible by the generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Ric
 hard (‘53) and Barbara Franke. Three to five fellowships of $2\,000 will
  be awarded to rising seniors to support senior essay\, research\, or art 
 project proposals that explore new and productive intellectual connections
  between science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary research or art pro
 jects should explicitly engage both scientific and humanistic issues or co
 ntent. Awards are intended to support research during the summer between j
 unior and senior year\, or during the following academic year.\n\nAwardees
  will be asked to participate in dinners with Franke Program faculty and o
 ur benefactors to discuss the proposed projects (in the fall) and to prese
 nt the final results of their work (during the spring semester).\n\nFellow
 ship monies are intended to offset costs related to the proposed research 
 or project. These include travel costs\, accommodation\, and supplies and 
 materials.\n\nApply here:\nhttp://bit.ly/3jfV9sS\n\n\n\nhttps://frankeprog
